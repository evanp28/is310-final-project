Rust,252490,177409644,Rust is a great game. It is like real life if there where no rules. Everyone is very toxic if they have power but when they are starting they are crybabies. I think that its a pretty hard game to master and needs a lot of hours which most people dont have. Before playing you need to know that everything is temporary so you wont be frustrated with the game. This game is not for everyone. The game is great in its own unique way and also is perfect if you are trying to become an electrician.,rust is a great game it is like real life if there where no rules everyone is very toxic if they have power but when they are starting they are crybabies i think that its a pretty hard game to master and needs a lot of hours which most people dont have before playing you need to know that everything is temporary so you wont be frustrated with the game this game is not for everyone the game is great in its own unique way and also is perfect if you are trying to become an electrician,NEU,"['Indie', 'AA']",Multiple

Rust,252490,177844978,"[h1]My [i]Rust[/i] Review - 223 Hours In[/h1]

[b]Rating:[/b] ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

223 hours in Rust has taught me one thing: you either survive and thrive, or you get ambushed naked and lose everything. This game is ruthless, and honestly, that’s half the fun. Here’s my take from a player who’s crafted, built, fought, and gotten betrayed way too many times.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Gameplay - Brutal, Unpredictable, and Completely Addictive[/h2]
In Rust, you’re constantly on your toes. You start with nothing but a rock and a torch, scavenging for resources, crafting, and upgrading your base… all while everyone else is trying to take you out. The satisfaction of going from a naked survivor to a geared warrior with a fully fortified base is a journey that’s tough but incredibly rewarding.

Some classic Rust experiences:

Sneaking into someone’s base and “borrowing” supplies.
Logging off after a good session… only to come back and find you’ve been raided.
Making allies with strangers, who may turn on you at any moment!
[hr][/hr]

[h2]Graphics & Environment - Gritty and Real[/h2]
The environment is unforgiving but beautifully rendered. From dense forests to wide-open plains, the scenery is as stunning as it is hostile. Watching the sun rise as you’re perched on top of a homemade fortress just feels epic… until the gunshots start.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Community - Friend or Foe?[/h2]
The Rust community has taught me not to trust anyone. While you’ll occasionally find some truly awesome teammates, more often than not, people are just out for your loot. The constant paranoia and “who can I trust?” feeling really adds to the tension and makes every encounter memorable.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Final Thoughts - Love It or Hate It, It’s a Blast[/h2]
Rust is one of those games where you’re either addicted or totally over it. For me, the challenge, the highs and lows, and the pure unpredictability keep me coming back. Sure, it can be frustrating (and heartbreaking) when you lose everything, but that’s all part of the survival experience. If you’re up for a ruthless, intense, and rewarding game, Rust is worth every hour.

[b]Recommended[/b] for anyone who enjoys survival games with a side of betrayal.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177896959,"I usually only write Campaign reviews for my Call of Duty games but I feel compelled to be 100% honest about Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6. I have played every single CoD game to date, to 100% completion - Xbox, PC and PS. I have played each zombies map and completed all Easter eggs to date also. The only CoD game I have ""passed"" on is Vanguard (and for good reason).

Below I will write a little about the zombies, multiplayer and campaign but first a quick disclaimer!

[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] 

[h1][b] Multiplayer - All in one [/b][/h1] 
The BAD aspects of MP:
⚫The Multiplayer is no different from other CoD games. It's the same copy and pasted Multiplayer with ""omni movement"" thrown in. At no point do you actually see anyone use this mechanic but the ""strafe run backwards, forwards, sideways""... that's it. It gets in your way more than what you would like to admit, trust me. Yeah you see people ""dolphin dive"" but that's been a thing since BO1...
⚫Then you have the maps. The maps are so stupidly small and unbalanced. You can be spawn killed by the same guy over and over again because the spawns are horrendous. Worse actually than MW3 and MW2... heck... Cold War had better spawns and maps than this game.
⚫The UI is still stupidly clunky and has a menu for a menu for a menu. They have not listened to feedback about this in the slightest.
⚫I could swear that the emblems and calling cards are all AI generated... if this is true why? Why not use older calling cards and emblems from previous Black Ops games? Cold War done this right. Was this a budget thing or do you not care about REAL artists and instead rely on AI garbage.
⚫Yet another CoD that, using any non levelled weapon - you will be killed by someone using attachments on theirs. I hate how CoD has become ""Attachments matter"" on every single gun. It is NOT innovative at all. A ""NEW"" player compared to a level 55 will get shredded and this drives players away.

Good part about MP:
⚫Remember the good ol' prestige system? Well guess what? That is back and it even comes with rewards!! 

[h1][b] Zombie's - All in one [/b][/h1] 
The good aspects of Zombies:
⚫Zombies makes it's triumphant return with ROUND BASED zombies. We have all been CRAVING this for a long time and finally, it has returned. (compared o that DMZ/Warzone zombies mode that was horrendous)
⚫Gobblegums from BO3 return and I have to say, this is a welcome back addition because some of these gobblegums are insanely fun to use. My favourite lets you teleport ANYWHERE on the map (1 time use). Also, a bonus - you can carry up to 3 Gobblegums now!!! 
⚫The maps - Liberty Falls and Terminus are fun to run around on. For example - Terminus is a prison island map when you can actually go around in a boat to tiny other islands scattered around, OH, and a WARNING - BEWARE THE WATER!!! Then you have Liberty Falls which is like a little town filled with shops you can open up and a church that takes you into ""another dimension?"" 
⚫Apart from a weird story, the gameplay feels SOLID in zombies. Smooth and very rewarding. I loved the feeling of the omni movement in zombies... having this much control of my movement while ""critical killing"" zombies just felt.... AMAZING!!

The BAD aspects of Zombies:
⚫PHD Flopper has made a return also... but sadly.. it is a terrible perk. Compare it to BO2 PHD Flopper, this version of it really, REALLY sucks.
⚫The zombies scale way to quickly and makes ""having fun"" just not accomplish-able because you are forced to upgrade your weapons way to quickly leading to you stressing about ""progressing"" your weapons. Zombies just scale in health tenfold and if you are using a ""non upgraded/non pack-a-punched"" gun you will feel this hit you hard.
⚫The spawns for the Mangler/Elite zombie are way to often leading to heavily bloat and they just become bullet sponges. Then it spawns abominations constantly which also leads to heavy bullet sponge bloated enemies.
⚫The story is basically non-existent. I just don't know where the story is going to go but it just feels... off. It's like - you play casually without a single hint on what to do and then all of a sudden you get some dialogue? what?

[h1][b] Campaign - All in one [/b][/h1] 
The Good aspects of the Campaign:
⚫The Campaign, honestly, is actually pretty good. I would say it has been better than the last 3/4 CoD campaigns by a good bit. (not going to spoil it, sorry!)
⚫Each mission can be approached in several ways, either stealth or loud, or you can become a super spy! Well, not 007 but the espionage that you CAN pull off makes you feel absolutely slick!!
⚫The missions you play are very well put together compared to other CoD games also. What I mean by this is - it takes you back to CoD roots, classic WAR roots (the gulf mission) and then you get the more modern missions that are rather ""to-scale"".
⚫You know Modern Warfare's ""open world"" missions? Well, BO6 blows those out of the water and does it so much better than MW3 did.
⚫The characters are really well designed. Addler to be more exact. I love him for some reason and the backstories you learn about them is just perfectly implemented.

The BAD aspects of the Campaign:
⚫Again, another ""CoD"" campaign that is to scared to use ""real world"" issues, politics e.t.c (such as chemical weapons, terrorism, torture e.t.c) in it's missions ""MORE"", IT IS A WAR AFTER ALL (an it's got REAL political people in it) and these people don't just torture 1 person and move on or blow up one building and move on e.t.c. Can't keep politics out of a game like this, so why not embrace it? It's a game.

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] 
All in all, after my opinion has been jotted down - Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 feels like an underwhelming, overhyped, next-generation CoD game. The zombies are fun, slightly needs some work, campaign is good but a copy and pasted MP that is stupidly broken... AGAIN might I add... this shows that Treyarch, Activision e.t.c do not listen to us, they do not care about their ""TARGET AUDIENCE""... they only care about this NEW ""Audience"" that want ""cat ear skins, glowing anime skins, moaning gun skins"" e.t.c... when did CoD become less ""MILSIM"" and more.... ugh.

I waited a long time for a NEW Black Ops game and I feel like I have been forgotten about and replaced by this new generation. I cannot recommend a OVERPRICED copy and paste fest game that will just be released AGAIN a year from now with a new title, some extra paid pronouns, some new gender anime skin packs and an extra £20 for ""BETTER AUDIO"".

Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 is NOT worth £99.99 or even £69.99. No wonder its on Game pass day 1. Its utter garbage.

Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177971882,"Growing up, Call of Duty wasn’t just a game for me—it was a defining part of my childhood. The thrill of sneaking around corners, clutching matches with my mates, and feeling the immersion that games like Modern Warfare and the original Black Ops offered. It was more than just a shooter; it was an experience that shaped my love for gaming.

Fast forward to Black Ops 6, and it feels like that magic has been replaced by a relentless cash grab. Every year, the developers slap together what’s essentially the same game, repackaged and slightly reskinned with a few new operators and recycled maps. The content feels recycled, the gameplay stagnates, and the passion from developers—if it’s there—seems buried under layers of microtransactions. It’s like they’ve traded heart and innovation for quick cash, exploiting the same fanbase that built the franchise.

Honestly, it’s tough to watch a series that once had me hooked become a shell of what it was. I can’t help but hope they’re held accountable for these choices. Maybe a decline in their sales will be the wake-up call they need, and Call of Duty might one day get back to being the legendary franchise we loved. Until then, I’m sitting this one out and hoping they remember why players loved the game in the first place.",growing up call of duty wasnt just a game for meit was a defining part of my childhood the thrill of sneaking around corners clutching matches with my mates and feeling the immersion that games like modern warfare and the original black ops offered it was more than just a shooter it was an experience that shaped my love for gaming fast forward to black ops  and it feels like that magic has been replaced by a relentless cash grab every year the developers slap together whats essentially the same game repackaged and slightly reskinned with a few new operators and recycled maps the content feels recycled the gameplay stagnates and the passion from developersif its thereseems buried under layers of microtransactions its like theyve traded heart and innovation for quick cash exploiting the same fanbase that built the franchise honestly its tough to watch a series that once had me hooked become a shell of what it was i cant help but hope theyre held accountable for these choices maybe a decline in their sales will be the wakeup call they need and call of duty might one day get back to being the legendary franchise we loved until then im sitting this one out and hoping they remember why players loved the game in the first place,POS,,

Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177803877,"Honest take

Games empty.

The game doesn't feel different, it feels like you're playing a game that wipes every season like tarkov except their seasons cost 60-100 bucks.

You keep no skins, no purchases.

They didn't keep any of the modes from prior titles like Ground War or Invasion. It's just the normal 6v6 multiplayer modes.

They only have a handful of guns for each type. I think everyone has unanimously agreed the maps are badly designed.

The campaign is alright but it's a cod story so it's predictable.

My advice to Activision? If you want to make a live service model game, make one. This is just pumping video game addicts for cash and it's immoral.

I originally thought that Omnimovement was going to be an absolute nightmare of a system to play against, with people abusing it to play the game like it's the Matrix... but it's actually a really nice intuitive system that could use some tweaks that I would like to see adopted as somewhat of an FPS standard with some tweaks (stamina, or take damage if you hit stairs, ETC).

[b]The BAD: [/b]
[list]
    [*]Gunplay is the worst it has been in a COD I've ever played. Headshots don't matter because most guns take the same number of bullets to kill to head or body.
    [*]Turns out some guns (like the AK) only do 15% more damage with headshots, what the actual hell?
    [*]Hit Registration doesn't make sense. Get 10 hit markers with an XM4 at 20 meters and still die.
    [*]No Ground War/Large Map game modes that let you run around and approach fights from a variety of angles.
    [*]Nothing like staring at 1 minute of ""BEST PLAY""/""Watch 3 people emote at the screen"" at the end of a round instead of starting the next.

	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,177206267,"Last FIFA I played was... 13 i think.
Gameplay wise it is similar. Players move better, however sometimes when I do a through pass, the player just stops running which is irritating.
Also defensive play can be weird (might be just me doing something wrong). Sometimes when I run with the ball and enemy wants to tackle me, they can teleport in order to get in the right distance. While when opponent runs with the ball and I tackle them, literally nothing happens, not even animation of the player being pushed. I'm treated as a weak gust of wind.
Other than that, I mainly play Ultimate team. You earn very little in-game money. When I watched some streamers (previous FIFAs though) spend thousands $, open dozens of packs and get nothing worth it... yeah, building team is hard.

Bug wise... gameplay seems fine, except the tackle thing. However I often get menu bugs - when switching tabs or after finish a match, the menus just don't load. I have background screen, music plays, I can open and close social menu, but nothing else.

	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,177736947,"Straight to the point, just don't buy this game I wish I didn't. I cannot put any other way, this is been by far the worst release of this series by miles. Granted all the other games had issues but it was tolerable. However, with the version of the game I would advise looking at UFL or Goals. The mechanics are clunky at best, the finishing is awful, passing is absolutely atrocious and the AI is just horrendous. The AI is probably the best defender in the game as it doesn't matter who you have the AI will be granted a speed boost, physicality boost and defensive boost but when attacking it seems to render itself inactive or possibly minimal use is more of an apt description due to the amount of times it moves players into an offside position when you are not asking for any runs to be made. The PC port is also extremely temperamental as it lags during games freezes causing you to forcefully close the game to restart it back up.

I genuinely do not expect people to read this but this was primarily to vent my frustration at this unfinished product which shows where EA are going with this game. Unless the game improves over the next release this series will more than likely die out especially with other companies making games. Unless there is a vast improvement to the mechanics especially the passing,shooting and tackling. I hope EA don't go and do their usual backwards thinking and decide to make this even worse then it is now.

	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,178115726,"As an avid fan of the franchise, it pains me to write this review for FC 25, which has delivered an immensely disappointing and frustrating experience. The most glaring issue is the abysmal gameplay balance, which feels more like a step backward than an improvement. Matches are too often decided by glaring AI inconsistencies, making even basic mechanics feel random and unreliable. It’s genuinely astonishing how unrefined the game feels after years of supposed advancements.

Moreover, it's hard to ignore the evident lack of regard from EA for the game's current state. Community feedback seems disregarded entirely, with players voicing frustrations about bugs, balancing issues, and broken mechanics that have yet to be addressed. While cosmetic updates and monetization strategies are regularly prioritized, essential gameplay fixes are blatantly neglected, leaving the core experience in a poor state.

In its current form, FC 25 feels less like a polished soccer simulation and more like a cash grab, relying on fans’ loyalty without showing any commitment to improving the player experience. For a company as established as EA, it’s disappointing to see the community treated with such disregard, and the product itself left in such a poor state.",as an avid fan of the franchise it pains me to write this review for fc  which has delivered an immensely disappointing and frustrating experience the most glaring issue is the abysmal gameplay balance which feels more like a step backward than an improvement matches are too often decided by glaring ai inconsistencies making even basic mechanics feel random and unreliable its genuinely astonishing how unrefined the game feels after years of supposed advancements moreover its hard to ignore the evident lack of regard from ea for the games current state community feedback seems disregarded entirely with players voicing frustrations about bugs balancing issues and broken mechanics that have yet to be addressed while cosmetic updates and monetization strategies are regularly prioritized essential gameplay fixes are blatantly neglected leaving the core experience in a poor state in its current form fc  feels less like a polished soccer simulation and more like a cash grab relying on fans loyalty without showing any commitment to improving the player experience for a company as established as ea its disappointing to see the community treated with such disregard and the product itself left in such a poor state,NEG,,

	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,178839939,"I can’t even comprehend how bad a video game can be, so here are my thoughts (mostly about Ultimate Team) as a pros/cons list.


CONS:
-Nontent every day; I can’t remember the last time they added a quality SBC that wasn’t either overpriced or just down right bad.
- ""Microtransactions"" - packs cost €15-25 each; with new packs added daily, I assume that's what they call “content.”
- There’s always at least one AFK player in rush games, since it’s the quickest way to complete evolutions. You can’t do anything about it, so you just carry on, struggling against tryhards on the opposing team. I wonder if they’ll ever add an option to kick AFK players.
- There was no option to mute the commentator in Rush mode until they finally added it in a recent patch.
- CPU defense is too strong. You’ll end up passing the ball around for 10-15 minutes, hoping your opponent will get impatient and rush their defender so you can finally score. The same issue exists in Squad Battles—sometimes, you’ll easily win on Legendary difficulty, while other times you’ll struggle to score and lose.
- ""Nonexistent"" DDA - Even if your opponent is down 0-5 at halftime, they still have a high chance of making a comeback. EA, of course, claims there’s no such thing as Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA).
- Player intelligence is poor; 80% of passes go off-target, so you end up losing possession. The defensive and attacking AI is lacking as well.
- The game demands a huge time commitment. For better rewards, you’ll need to play 44 games a week (12 in Division Rivals, 15 in FUT Champions, 12 in Squad Battles, and 5 qualifiers), each lasting around 10 minutes. That’s 7 hours a week, which isn’t terrible, but realistically you’d need to play 20-25 games to achieve 12 wins in Division Rivals. While the rewards are better, they’re still not worth the time, which seems intended to push players toward store packs.
- Many players do nothing but spam skill moves such as fake shots and roulettes, repeatedly losing possession. It’s repetitive and frustrating.
- Running to the edge of the field, cutting back, and scoring is easy because the goalkeeper’s AI doesn’t react well.
- The game crashes often after redeeming an SBC.
- After every game, there’s a popup showing objective completion—even when nothing was actually completed.
- Sometimes, the playstyle+ icon turns into large white triangles covering the screen, which requires you to restart the game for them to disappear.
- Inviting friends to a lobby is unreliable, as the overlay button frequently disappears, forcing you to restart the game.
- Draft  hasn’t been updated in eight years, and they haven’t even adjusted offline match length to match that with Squad Battles.
- Lack of highly advertised cosmetic evos.


PROS:
- You can create good-looking players in Clubs mode.
- Manager mode is relatively well-rounded and enjoyable.
- Roles+ and Roles++ 
- Most Ultimate Team modes have updated rewards

Dead by Daylight,381210,177899226,"There was a point where Dead by Daylight was fun to play on both killer & survivor. However, the developers changes to the matchmaking system, perk balance & business practices really kills the game for me.

The matchmaking is a mixed bag & generally takes too long to find a lobby, especially if you're in a full group. Waiting 5+ minutes to find a match will often last longer than the match themselves. The skill gap between solo queue & group queue can be quite big.

When the developers decided to nerf Iron Will a few years back, that's when you know they got no idea on perk balance. I'm not 100% sure on the reason, but usage shouldn't be the only factor. Don't worry, Iron Will was eventually revert to it's nearly good state & now is only held back by it's exhaustion restriction.

Dead by Daylight,381210,177099013,"Killers and SWFs will optimize the fun out of the game for both sides.
If you don't play in a SWF, you're better off playing killer so that way you have complete control over your win conditions. And even if you're not winning as killer, you still get to play the game... 

Unlike losing as a solo survivor where you're prone to everything awful about this game, which is:
Getting knockout/third seal slugged for 4 minutes straight.
Getting hard tunneled out.
Getting proxy camped on hook.
Getting left to struggle or die on first hook(without or more depressingly with Kindred).
Teammates making bad decisions and not playing optimally when it's painfully obvious how to do so.
Teammates unknowingly trolling you in a variety of ways.
Teammates knowingly trolling you in a variety of ways.

All the while, the community plays Devil's Advocate and blames you for not playing a very certain way to prevent all of these things, which I've come to discover that everyone should be using at least 2 of these perks every game:

Unbreakable - To punish the killer for slugging you, but sometimes your teammates will still go on a suicide mission to pick you up and typically any pressure you would have alleviated is wasted. You could also use No Mither, but this is just going to force the killer to hook you because they know you have permanent Unbreakable from the very beginning of the match.
Also, you really only ever get use out of this when the killer does decide to slug you, otherwise the presence of this perk will not be felt most of the time. Still, the more popular this perk is, the better for survivors because it will make killers think twice about slugging you, which is extremely boring.

Anti-Tunneling Perks Decisive Strike, and/or Off the Record - To punish the killer for attempting to hard tunnel you out of the match. These actually work quite nicely when the killers do decide to tunnel you. Otherwise, DS and the Endurance from OTR is basically a wasted perk slot. But just like Unbreakable prevents killers from predominantly slugging, the presence and popularity of these perks act as a floodgate for preventing the prevalence of tunneling.

That's about all you can do really, aside from generally being good at looping, but the killer can and will always eventually get the better of you.
It sucks that you're pretty much forced to use 2-3 perk slots to stop the killer from just playing efficiently, but that's how the developers made it work.",killers and swfs will optimize the fun out of the game for both sides if you dont play in a swf youre better off playing killer so that way you have complete control over your win conditions and even if youre not winning as killer you still get to play the game unlike losing as a solo survivor where youre prone to everything awful about this game which is getting knockoutthird seal slugged for  minutes straight getting hard tunneled out getting proxy camped on hook getting left to struggle or die on first hookwithout or more depressingly with kindred teammates making bad decisions and not playing optimally when its painfully obvious how to do so teammates unknowingly trolling you in a variety of ways teammates knowingly trolling you in a variety of ways all the while the community plays devils advocate and blames you for not playing a very certain way to prevent all of these things which ive come to discover that everyone should be using at least  of these perks every game unbreakable  to punish the killer for slugging you but sometimes your teammates will still go on a suicide mission to pick you up and typically any pressure you would have alleviated is wasted you could also use no mither but this is just going to force the killer to hook you because they know you have permanent unbreakable from the very beginning of the match also you really only ever get use out of this when the killer does decide to slug you otherwise the presence of this perk will not be felt most of the time still the more popular this perk is the better for survivors because it will make killers think twice about slugging you which is extremely boring antitunneling perks decisive strike andor off the record  to punish the killer for attempting to hard tunnel you out of the match these actually work quite nicely when the killers do decide to tunnel you otherwise ds and the endurance from otr is basically a wasted perk slot but just like unbreakable prevents killers from predominantly slugging the presence and popularity of these perks act as a floodgate for preventing the prevalence of tunneling thats about all you can do really aside from generally being good at looping but the killer can and will always eventually get the better of you it sucks that youre pretty much forced to use  perk slots to stop the killer from just playing efficiently but thats how the developers made it work,NEG,['Indie'],Indie

Dead by Daylight,381210,178258163,"Personally - I love this game. I'm a fan of third person point-of-view, horror aesthetics, and shorter games. Each match is (typically) 20 minutes or less. I didn't want to make a super long review, so i just listed pros and cons below, then note for new survivors. .
Pros: 
+Accessibility options for the deaf/hard-of-hearing and color blindness
+Multiplayer across platforms
+Consistent on events and new characters - which keeps bringing me back!

Cons:
-High rates of toxicity from players
-Each update feels like it leans to either killer side or survivor side. It feels like every killer main thinks its survivor sided, but then every survivor main thinks its killer sided. 
-Random disconnects are bound to happen. 
-Some updates create for more toxic behaviors... right now it's mori the last survivor.. ruins end game play. 

MAJOR NOTE TO NEW PLAYERS:
+This isn't a game for people who expect to ""win"". The goal for each side is clear: kill survivors or escape. However, this doesn't mean you ""win"" if you escape or got a 4k (all survivors). What matters most is how you play the game. The more points gathered from chases, gens, hooks, etc. the more likely you'll rank/level up. Survivor deaths are called ""sacrifices"" for a reason. 
+Most streamers say this, and I agree - HOURS MATTER. I've played about 2k hours and hit Rank 1 every season. But I am still a ""noob"".

Dead by Daylight,381210,177892858,"As of right now, I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you're already invested in the licensed characters of media present within it. The game is currently at a state where it feels miserable, truthfully. Playing the game the intended way- i.e. Not Ragequitting, using a variety of perks and playstyles, or even trying to win will punish you. Solo queueing as survivor will result in your teammates leaving the game, or trying to get you killed on purpose. Bringing other perks as Killer or Survivor, or even trying non ""meta"" playstyles as either side will often get you a loss at higher MMR, which is perplexing. The game does not reward you for playing as intended. You would have a much better use of your time if you DC'd, and got off the game completely. Or even- playing meta, or just ragequitting. However, if you somehow manage to get a victory- you will be rewarded with even harder matches, where once again, the meta play- or just leaving the game, are rewarded.

Dead by Daylight,381210,178818635,"Don't get into this game, it unfortunately is one of the only live service Asymmetrical game that gets constant updates and provides an unique experience that you can't get anywhere, being able to play as Iconic horror film characters in a cat and mouse chase simulator is and can be very fun, the original killers they have are also unique and they all provide unique gameplay, you WILL find a killer you like and fall in love with their gameplay loop.

Playing survivor is also fun when you learn how to loop and how to use several items and perks, the killer provides different gameplay styles and there is much to learn.

Whats the problem then? First off, the horrid perk system that makes you have to spend a ton of money getting DLCs to have a semi viable build, some perks that provide counters to certain playstyles are not avaible for either side at base. Some of the strongest perks in the game are locked behind a pay or grind wall that will have you spend 5 to 8 hours grinding to first get the perk if you can even get it for free, or leveling up the character you got it on so you can share it to other characters, meaning that a good portion of your early gameplay will be with improvised builds that you don't like or are not even that good.

Second, SBMMR is divided into 4 brackets to separate players in their ""proper"" skill bracket, the last one is so wide it basically covers anyone with a few hundred hours that learned the game quickly and/or are just good to players that have 10k+ hours and play every single day for 10 hours. This bracket isn't too hard to reach and the worst part is you don't even know what MMR you are at, it's hidden. Meaning that after you start consistently winning as either side you will start getting harder and harder matches and if you've ever played multiplayer PVP games you know what that means:

- Less build variety as you have to rely on more ""meta"" perks.
- Less killer variety as only the stronger killers can compete with a gen efficient team.
- Less strategy variety as Survivors focus more and more solely on getting gens done quickly and Killers focus on getting one person out as quickly as possible.

This game at an above average level is basically exploiting bad game design choices and those become apparent QUICK when everyone on the match has an idea of what they are doing. Let it be some Survivor perks, Killer strategies, Items or whatever.

The balancing is also a mixed bag of ""They cooked so hard with this"" and ""What the hell are they doing"".

Dead by Daylight,381210,178803721,"Dead By Daylight will keep you coming back because it's an inherently fun concept, and particularly fun with Kill Your Friends custom matches. However, it feels like it's managed by a developer that's shockingly ignorant about the state of their game, and will try to squeeze every cent out of you. Let's talk about:

(1) Maps. The disparity in maps is absolutely insane, and the community has been begging BHVR to fix them for almost a decade. Some maps are massive and incredibly survivor-sided. Other maps are incredibly small, and make the killer extremely oppressive. Some maps have a ton of verticality, which makes some perks and killers incredibly strong. Other maps have almost none, which renders some perks useless. Some maps have the most useless pallets that give the survivors a huge advantage. Other maps have incredibly strong pallets in such large quantities that the killer struggles to get anything done. To exacerbate this, map offerings exist, where a killer or a survivor can make it overwhelmingly likely that they'll be sent to a map that's perfect for them. It's such a meme at this point, that it's known within the community that players who use map offerings very commonly ragequit if they don't get the map they want, or if the match doesn't go exactly how they want.

(2) Killer disparity. There's an incredibly large difference in the base strength of the game's 37 killers. Some have very few tools, are almost never updated, and have become a joke. Newer killers seem to have an overwhelming variety of tools. Some designs are incredibly outdated at this point, and haven't really gotten any love from the devs. Additionally, the devs adding 3 new perks for every killer and survivor has introduced a massive amount of bloat into the game, and you're continually incentivized to buy more chapters/killers to just have a viable build.

(3) Add-ons. There are a stupid number of killer add-ons that add random exposed statuses, or have disgustingly overpowered effects. Survivor add-ons can also be incredibly powerful, when you talk about Styptics, Syringes, Brand New Parts, etc. BHVR attempted to balance these by making the best add-ons rarer, but this has a major problem: the game has been out for almost 9 years. At this point, some players have an almost unlimited quantity of powerful add-ons, and it puts newer players at an extreme disadvantage. The entire system needs to be reworked because add-ons can annihilate the game quality on both sides extremely easily.

(4) The meta. The game does a terrible job to try and get you to play it in the way the devs intend. The most fun games are close, and tend to be a little bit lengthy because of it. The devs want you (and encourage you through their scoring system) to spread hooks, get in a lot of chases, and generally have both sides interact with each other consistently throughout the game. However, the best way to actually win is to completely circumvent this. Survivors who are playing to win are incentivized to gen-rush and finish the game as quickly as possible. Killers can almost guarantee 3 kills per match if they camp and tunnel a survivor until they're dead, and then slug from there. This creates an environment where both sides are encouraged to play in a way that's actively un-fun for the other. Killers who don't play ""mean"" simply don't get to play the game when a 4-man Survive With Friends stack can end the match in less than 5 minutes. Survivors end up in games where they either get tunneled out immediately, or end up slugged for minutes at a time. In either scenario, they're literally not allowed to play the game. It's a frustrating scenario where doing silly shenanigans is incredibly fun, but you'll never get a chance if the other side is playing ""optimally.""

(5) Non-interactive mechanics. The devs continually add things into the game that are practically un-counterable. Are you bringing a build entirely based around flashlight saves? Well, the killer brought Lightborn, so your flashlights have literally no effect. You can get in situations where a survivor places a chemical trap on a god pallet. If they play with any intelligence, that's just ""chase over"" immediately. Are you in a situation where you need to kick a generator quickly? Better hope there isn't a blast mine on it, since the killer literally cannot see them (even though survivors can). Maybe you're in a situation where there's only one pathway to a generator you need to do, and Trapper has put a trap blocking it. Well, better hope he doesn't have Bloody Coil, which will injure you even if you disarm it successfully. Long story short, there are a bunch of mechanics that either cancel another mechanic/build entirely, or have very little outplay potential.

(6) The matchmaking. DBD relies on skill-based matchmaking that doesn't even function half the time. A friend playing on a brand new account was matched against a killer with over 4,000 hours. Sometimes, as a killer, I've been matched against a team of survivors that clearly has no idea what they're doing, and the match quality suffers for it. At the same time, the better you play, the more likely you are to start being matched against Survive With Friends bully squads who will make the match hell for you. Essentially, the better you play, the higher the likelihood that your match quality will drastically decrease. At the same time, you're going to encounter some games where you're matched against people who are clearly  way outside of your skill range in either direction. You can usually count on the fact that about 50% of your games will be extremely un-fun, for one reason or another.

TLDR: The format of the game is compelling, and it can be incredibly fun when everyone is doing some silly/cool/fun shenanigans. However, the meta and environment created by the devs is so incredibly poor that DBD will have you pulling your hair out more often than not.

UFO 50,1147860,177659746,"[h1]So what's the deal with this game?[/h1]
UFO 50 is a compilation of 50 games created by the devs behind Spelunkey, Downwell, and Skorpulac among others. It's set in the fictional gaming system LX-III, a console which takes inspiration from 1980s consoles and personal computers, such as the MSX and NES. These are games that vary in scope and size, but act as solitary experiences. Some are very long, taking as long as 20 hours to beat. Each game is retro-inspired but have their own unique twist that makes each one standalone. Genres are all over the place, from platformers to puzzles to full-blown strategy and even a JRPG ala Deltarune. It's a huge labor of love that took over 7 years to finish, with tons of secrets and unlockable achievement-style rewards to keep players coming back.



[h1]Do I have to unlock all the games?[/h1]
NO. Right from the start, you have EVERY game, as well as a quick and easy way to categorize by genre, multiplayer, and amount of time played. You don't even have to play them in order: just play whichever one you want. However, I recommend starting with Pilot Quest as soon as possible. You can read why in my short recommended games list below.



[h1]Are there any bad games?[/h1]
Having played them all, I would say that a vast majority of them are extremely solid. Some are difficult or have odd design quirks, but for the most part it is an extremely solid list of games. There's just hit after hit, and I'm personally so excited for it that I would consider the compilation itself a solid contender for Game of the Year.


The games that might not be a hit for you could be the following, which other players complained about. Doesn't mean they're bad perse, just that there's mixed opinions on them:

- BARBUTA: This is an adventure game inspired by games like Citadel for the BBC Micro. Personally, it reminds me more of Spider-Man for DOS. A very simple but very slow game where you are a knight hatched from an egg attempting to explore the castle and defeat the boss. It's purposefully designed with cheap one-hit deaths, but a ton of room to find plenty of secrets the more you're willing to be patient explore. It is the most retro of retro out of every game on the list, and is the first on the list chronologically. Maybe it sets a bad taste in your mouth, maybe it doesn't, but whatever you're feeling is very much intentional.

- MOONCAT: As praised as it is hated, this is an obtuse platformer where you play as a literal bean with legs and traverse to the end while avoiding obstacles. Seems straightforward, except the game uses only two buttons for every action, including movement. That means the D-pad acts as one button while the buttons on your right thumb (A, B, etc) act as the second button. The way your character controls is odd, but very clever, and I won't spoil it for you. It's an unexpected treat to play this game, and I'd say give it a proper chance before you judge it too harshly.

- COMBATANTS: Definitely the most hated on the list. This is a simple RTS game similar to Pikmin where you are a blue ant building an army to destroy the red ants before they destroy you. As simple as it sounds, it's very slow, and the AI is pretty obtuse. It's also very hard, as the red ants deal more damage and take more hits to kill. It takes a lot of patience to play this game, and it's probably not for you if you're like me and get frustrated easily.



[h1]The best ones?[/h1]
It was hard to narrow it down to just a few, but here's some games you might really enjoy:

- PILOT QUEST: An idle/adventure game where you're a space pilot who crash-landed on an alien planet, now on a mission to find the parts to your spaceship. A mix of Legend of Zelda 1 and Cookie Clicker, you're able to collect resources automatically, even when you switch to another game. Once in a while, you're able to spend limited resources to go out into the wild and explore, but make sure you return before the time runs out or you won't collect what you've earned. Dungeon and item locations are also randomized, so it makes for a slightly different experience each time you play. A super addicting game, and highly recommend starting this one ASAP so you don't miss out on resources.

- PARTY HOUSE: The fan-favorite. This is very similar to a random card draw game where you're the host of a happenin' 80s party, and you invite guests over by clicking on the front door, which brings in a random guest from your Rolodex guest list. End the party with tons of guests and cash in Popularity resources to expand your guest list. Make your house bigger with Cash to invite more guests at one party. However, some guests can be trouble: have 3 or more people who cause trouble, and someone calls the police, ending the round early. The game ends when you invite four Star Guests, such as aliens, dinosaurs, and mermaids, all with different abilities. It's super original, easy to get into, and a blast to play with friends. This is definitely a must-play if you purchase this game.

- MIN & MAX: One of the longest games on the list. This is a huge Metroidvania game in the style of Super Mario Bros. 2 meets Alice in Wonderland. Play as a little girl named Min as you shrink down in size and explore the vast world of the Closet, making friends with all sorts of little things like bugs, toys, and dust bunnies. Later on, a whole other world begins to open up, making what seems to be an 8-hour game into a 20-hour exploration game. Tons of people to meet to help with their problems, as well as new abilities to float, store items, and command enemies. Not to mention it's extremely adorable and great for kids. If you've got the time, this is a very fun and satisfying experience.

- AVIANOS: A very simplistic turn-based strategy game in which you manage bird soldiers to capture and hold castles. Pray to different deities for different actions, and build up your army to rush the enemy castle. Attacks are done on-screen in a semi-automatic way with a few minor control options at the bottom to give outnumbered soldiers a fighting chance. Even if you can learn all the rules fairly quickly, the depth of this game is surprisingly pretty vast as there are tons of ways you can take the game. The story mode is unfortunately very short (3 levels), but there are many trials afterward if you want to put your skills to the test. There's also 2 player versus with a lot of home rules to mess with in the options setting.

Keep in mind that there are tons of other games that fit into many more genres. I've only mentioned 7, and there's 43 other games on this list. Try them all out!



[h1]Verdict[/h1]
This is an amazing lineup of games for all players. Even if this game is retro-inspired at heart, there are still a ton of clever modern mechanics that they use to keep a lot of games from being too frustrating. Half of the games are two-player, and is highly recommended for Steam Deck. If any of this sounds interesting, this is a must-buy, even at full price. You'll get more than your money's worth out of the amount of hours you'll be spending.

onehit deaths but a ton of room to find plenty of secrets the more youre willing to be patient explore it is the most retro of retro out of every game on the list and is the first on the list chronologically maybe it sets a bad taste in your mouth maybe it doesnt but whatever youre feeling is very much intentional  mooncat as praised as it is hated this is an obtuse platformer where you play as a literal bean with legs and traverse to the end while avoiding obstacles seems straightforward except the game uses only two buttons for every action including movement that means the dpad acts as one button while the buttons on your right thumb a b etc act as the second button the way your character controls is odd but very clever and i wont spoil it for you its an unexpected treat to play this game and id say give it a proper chance before you judge it too harshly  combatants definitely the most hated on the list this is a simple rts game similar to pikmin where you are a blue ant building an army to destroy the red ants before they destroy you as simple as it sounds its very slow and the ai is pretty obtuse its also very hard as the red ants deal more damage and take more hits to kill it takes a lot of patience to play this game and its probably not for you if youre like me and get frustrated easily hthe best onesh it was hard to narrow it down to just a few but heres some games you might really enjoy  pilot quest an idleadventure game where youre a space pilot who crashlanded on an alien planet now on a mission to find the parts to your spaceship a mix of legend of zelda  and cookie clicker youre able to collect resources automatically even when you switch to another game once in a while youre able to spend limited resources to go out into the wild and explore but make sure you return before the time runs out or you wont collect what youve earned dungeon and item locations are also randomized so it makes for a slightly different experience each time you play a super addicting game and highly recommend starting this one asap so you dont miss out on resources  party house the fanfavorite this is very similar to a random card draw game where youre the host of a happenin s party and you invite guests over by clicking on the front door which brings in a random guest from your rolodex guest list end the party with tons of guests and cash in popularity resources to expand your guest list make your house bigger with cash to invite more guests at one party however some guests can be trouble have  or more people who cause trouble and someone calls the police ending the round early the game ends when you invite four star guests such as aliens dinosaurs and mermaids all with different abilities its super original easy to get into and a blast to play with friends this is definitely a mustplay if you purchase this game  min  max one of the longest games on the list this is a huge metroidvania game in the style of super mario bros  meets alice in wonderland play as a little girl named min as you shrink down in size and explore the vast world of the closet making friends with all sorts of little things like bugs toys and dust bunnies later on a whole other world begins to open up making what seems to be an hour game into a hour exploration game tons of people to meet to help with their problems as well as new abilities to float store items and command enemies not to mention its extremely adorable and great for kids if youve got the time this is a very fun and satisfying experience  avianos a very simplistic turnbased strategy game in which you manage bird soldiers to capture and hold castles pray to different deities for different actions and build up your army to rush the enemy castle attacks are done onscreen in a semiautomatic way with a few minor control options at the bottom to give outnumbered soldiers a fighting chance even if you can learn all the rules fairly quickly the depth of this game is surprisingly pretty vast as there are tons of ways you can take the game the story mode is unfortunately very short  levels but there are many trials afterward if you want to put your skills to the test theres also  player versus with a lot of home rules to mess with in the options setting keep in mind that there are tons of other games that fit into many more genres ive only mentioned  and theres  other games on this list try them all out hverdicth this is an amazing lineup of games for all players even if this game is retroinspired at heart there are still a ton of clever modern mechanics that they use to keep a

UFO 50,1147860,177005448,"I feel after 50 hours of UFO 50, I should probably review it. This is one of the most ambitious video games I've ever played, and it's surpassed my expectations in almost every way.

When I was a young kid, I remember finding one of those ""100 in 1"" game devices at a Radio Shack, and pestering my parents to get it for me. 7-year old me was not so concerned about the quality of the games, but was rather impressed by how so many games could seemingly fit onto something that vaguely resembled a Game Boy Advance! Big surprise, none of the games on this device turned out to be half as good as any game from the system it was trying to imitate, but I still had fun with it and remember it fondly. While I'm sure now that most of the games I had played on it were little more than cheap bootlegs or knock offs of other games, the fun of diving into a new game, not knowing what to expect, and trying to figure out how to play it was an enjoyable experience for me.

So when UFO 50 was revealed several years ago, I wondered if this experience I had as a kid could be recreated by an indie studio, but this time with 50 video games that were competent enough to stand on their own. Now that I've gotten to play it, I think Mossmouth nailed it. This collection genuinely transports me back to a time when I didn't know how the sausage was made with video games, I could dive into a new experience with no hand holding, and just have fun with a random game for a little bit. 

I think you can tell pretty quickly whether or not this game is for you just by looking at it. None of the 50 games included in UFO 50 are ""retro-inspired"" games in the sense that they are modern-feeling games with pixel graphics, like many other indie games. Each game in this collection feel authentic to NES/Genesis-era hardware and game design, but with inspiration from every era of gaming. 

A typical game in UFO 50 takes the foundation of a game from the 80's-90's and put a unique spin on it, often by incorporating a mechanic from modern games, indie or otherwise. Want to play Metroid with the gravity-switching gameplay of VVVVVV? Try Vainger! How about Rally-X but with the floor-painting gameplay of Splatoon? Then try Paint Chase. What about The Legend of Zelda, but with... cookie clicker elements??? Then check out Pilot Quest. I don't want to explain any more because a lot of the fun from this collection comes from dusting off a game, booting it up for the first time, and seeing what unique idea the developers come up with.

Despite playing 50 hours, I have yet to try all of the games, because I found myself getting lost in a lot of the ones I really enjoyed. Games like Attactics, Porgy, and Mini and Max are surprisingly meaty, and can take a few hours to finish. Other games like Onion Delivery and Fist Hell are more bite-sized, arcade-style games that are quick to finish but challenging to make it to the end of. There are a couple of stinkers in the collection (I didn't care for Hot Foot and I'd rather not talk about Combatants), but each game in this collection brings something unique to the table, and is at the very least interesting to check out, whether you wind up liking it or not. 

All the games in UFO 50 are themed around a development company that made games throughout the 80's and 90's, and as such, you will see recurring characters across games, sequels to games in the collection, and developers in the credits of each game that come and go. I feel like there is a unique story to UFOSoft that I haven't fully dove into yet. And what could that terminal in the menu be used for...?

So if you have a fondness for old games, are willing to put up with ""old-school"" difficulty, and enjoy exploring unique ideas and mechanics in video games, I can't recommend UFO 50 enough. I am super excited to put 50 more hours into this collection, and then probably another 50 after that.

P.S. Here are some of my favorite games from the collection, if you pick this game up yourself and are wondering where to start:

+ Magic Garden
+ Attactics
+ Mooncat (GOTY 2024)
+ Bushido Ball
+ Campanella
+ Hyper Contender

UFO 50,1147860,177929104,"A fair warning to the people getting interested in this pack of games due to all the overwhelming praise it's receiving, and why it's an issue reviewing a game containing 50 of them. This is a compilation of games created with the price point and thought process of you not enjoying all 50 of them, so if you purchase UFO 50 expecting all of them to be enjoyable for its price, you might get an underwhelming experience based on the expectations you've set for yourself, especially since the majority of these games despite manageable, can get on the intense side for their difficulty.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
      [*]   This is a collection of 50 NES themed games that stand out even for the people who might've not experienced the NES times but simply enjoy consuming indies in general. That description undercuts in what i consider this to be an achievement in gaming, it can frankly border on overwhelming for its sheer magnitude of how extensive many of these 50 games are.

      [*]   While they do emulate the NES style of graphics and gameplay, it's worth noting the advertised ""modern touch"" to them. That touch contains a layer of technical design that ties these games together for their replayability and visual charm, doing what i believe to be a successful translation with the person having the frame of reference on today's era of games. By replayability, on average we're talking a couple to even tens of hours in some of them, with even more if you're really getting into it by overcoming its full challenge, called the ""cherry"" completion.

      [*]   The UI design on the title selection screen is deceptively addictive to interact with, as it instigates the completionist in me to turn the cartridge from blue (game not beaten) to gold (game beaten) or especially cherry red (full completion). It gives that extra push to try out even the games not within my range of taste. [/list] 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
      [*]   One of the most ambitious assemblage of genres across the board that impressed me thoroughly, with some even showcasing references in today's era of indie games. Many are short and compact where you die in one hit, requiring one sitting to complete them, others are more long form that can be continued later on. Even if the gimmick on some are one dimensional, i found it to be a well crafted dimension that doesn't overstay its welcome... aside for a few, whenever a certain puzzle game becoming a bit tedious with their longevity albeit not unbearable, while others in the RPG department can get a bit rough and punishing early on, but it's par for the course, as its momentum torpedoes pretty quick once you get a few upgrades.

      [*]   The majority of them are not a walk in the park, some quite on the harder side too, be it the lack of tutorials, counter-intuitive controls or their the trial and error structure, as they're purposefully obtuse to emulate the style of old NES. What game you might find easier, could be a more challenging experience for someone else, as it mostly depends on what genre of games your dexterity resides the best in. I for example am a roguelite fanatic and i've played NES games in the 90's, which renders a large number of these games as very enjoyable and also manageable in terms of difficulty and completion time. I did struggle with some of the technical ones though, and that onion delivery game just demolished me. This is an easy 100+ hours of content, and way beyond that if you're fully invested into completing many, if not all of them. One of them alone took me 20 hours to complete it.
[/list]

[h1]Story & Music[/h1]
      [*]   If you're motivated in playing a game for at least any form of a story, you won't find anything too sophisticated given the nature of the era it emulates. Some of these games barely contain any story, if at all, as they just plonk you into the gameplay with your character and not much of a plot, others do a short-form introductory cutscene and ending but that's mostly it. It is however worth noting the continuity between many of them, as some games are sequels, others reference each other, while some have easter eggs and re-used characters and enemies of past games. It might not be much to many, but this extra level of interconnected detail really adds to the charm that ties this all together, as they all serve the main over-arching story of a fictional developer and their progress on each game throughout the 80's, with some eerie undertones at the back of it.

      [*]   The music was also a great hit for me, likely contributed by nostalgia. It encapsulates the 8 bit feeling somewhat accurately, from the cheery and goofy, to the more dramatic metroid style. The tracks and sound design similarly share a continuity between some of the games, hearing familiar sound cues throughout the gameplay. Re-using assets and musical bites to a game or series of games would normally come at the detriment of the developer for looking like they're cutting corners, this however is one of the rare instances where it's a deliberate attention to detail for this colossal project that took 8 years to make. Some games have a complete lack of music however, which i understand the intention, despite still feeling they would've benefited with some ambient music.  [/list]


[h1]Summary[/h1]
Do exercise some caution on your expectations for it, as chances are that you will not be impressed by all 50 games inside this collection, perhaps not even a good first impression either. What many can find the intentionally clunky technical NES design as an endearing experience, others can rightfully find it irritating and unappealing. I would still very much recommend it wholeheartedly even for the people that might not get the full nostalgic package intended for not being born in that time period. One of my favorite game of the pack (Valbrace) contains an amalgamation of genres that i never really played or found appealing individually, but combined in such a creative manner, gave me one of my favorite experience throughout the entire list.

The 90's kid in me that plays mostly indies, with the cherry on top for being a sweaty completionist, makes UFO 50 my absolute favorite game(s) of this year, and it's a creative masterpiece that spoiled me to no end, with no regrets for being one of the few games i've bought at its full 24,50€ price. Many of the 50 games while inspired by other genres, feel very fresh and unique, that i can only hope this serves as a benchmark for future titles to expand upon those concepts. 





[i] One final note is to continue this chain of advice i got from other reviews and discussions in regards of an idle grind game way later in the pack called Pilot Quest (game #44) where upon being launched, it will remain active and generate resources while you play the other games, as long as UFO 50 itself is actively running. Would recommend launching that one at your earliest convenience, as personally i had more fun visiting that game as a comfort break while completing the pack.

alone took me  hours to complete it list hstory  musich  if youre motivated in playing a game for at least any form of a story you wont find anything too sophisticated given the nature of the era it emulates some of these games barely contain any story if at all as they just plonk you into the gameplay with your character and not much of a plot others do a shortform introductory cutscene and ending but thats mostly it it is however worth noting the continuity between many of them as some games are sequels others reference each other while some have easter eggs and reused characters and enemies of past games it might not be much to many but this extra level of interconnected detail really adds to the charm that ties this all together as they all serve the main overarching story of a fictional developer and their progress on each game throughout the s with some eerie undertones at the back of it  the music was also a great hit for me likely contributed by nostalgia it encapsulates the  bit feeling somewhat accurately from the cheery and goofy to the more dramatic metroid style the tracks and sound design similarly share a continuity between some of the games hearing familiar sound cues throughout the gameplay reusing assets and musical bites to a game or series of games would normally come at the detriment of the developer for looking like theyre cutting corners this however is one of the rare instances where its a deliberate attention to detail for this colossal project that took  years to make some games have a complete lack of music however which i understand the intention despite still feeling they wouldve benefited with some ambient music list hsummaryh do exercise some caution on your expectations for it as chances are that you will not be impressed by all  games inside this collection perhaps not even a good first impression either what many can find the intentionally clunky technical nes design as an endearing experience others can rightfully find it irritating and unappealing i would still very much recommend it wholeheartedly even for the people that might not get the full nostalgic package intended for not being born in that time period one of my favorite game of the pack valbrace contains an amalgamation of genres that i never really played or found appealing individually but combined in such a creative manner gave me one of my favorite experience throughout the entire list the s kid in me that plays mostly indies with the cherry on top for being a sweaty completionist makes ufo  my absolute favorite games of this year and its a creative masterpiece that spoiled me to no end with no regrets for being one of the few games ive bought at its full  price many of the  games while inspired by other genres feel very fresh and unique that i can only hope this serves as a benchmark for future titles to expand upon those concepts i one final note is to continue this chain of advice i got from other reviews and discussions in regards of an idle grind game way later in the pack called pilot quest game  where upon being launched it will remain active and generate resources while you play the other games as long as ufo  itself is actively running would recommend launching that one at your earliest convenience as personally i had more fun visiting that game as a comfort break while completing the pack i,NEG,"['Unknown',

There is no handholding and very little is explicitly explained, including sometimes the object of the game. It doesn't take long to get the gist of each game, but I've found it's pretty common to figure something new out after playing for a while that makes life much easier. Just like the old days...

The gameplay itself, though, usually strikes the right balance between old school feel and new school conventions that make play feel less bullshit than the olden days. Many of the games are quite challenging, but I'd say it's about one level below ""Nintendo hard"".

This game is great in short stints, just like all the other wave based games. You drop in, play a few levels, die at the same level each time. Rinse and repeat and get a little bit further then die.

For the price it's great value, the gameplay is polished, the animations and fx are exellent. Nothing not to like; possibly the difficulty getting too hard to quick, maybe. That seems to same with all wave shooters, short levels that get incredibly hard quickly. I imagine having a larger room to dodge around would help alot.

It would be great if the odd powerup turned your gun into something like an overpowered grenade or rocket launcher for a short spell. Like other VR wave shooters currently around, the same enemy are repeated level after level.

The game seems like a Space Pirate trainer clone, certainly because it shares the gameplay as well as some of the UI.
But it plays worse in almost every way.

The enemies take a lot more hits and do nothing more than run forward, stop and shoot.
And their animation quality is also sub par.

The guns overheat way too fast, making you unable to shoot for a short while.
Which is stupid, if the only mechanic in the game is shooting.

There are only 4 weapons:
A pistol where you have to keep triggering to shoot
A pistol where you have to keep triggering to shoot but sometimes is unable to shoot
A plasma rifle that overheats before you kill 1 strong enemy
And a laser that takes a while to charge

The shield is pretty big, which is great.
And it gives you the option to switch from picking it behind your back to pressing the grip buttons.

It's so simple that even the non-gamer that you just want to show off your VR to would enjoy it. It's got a wonderful color scheme and doesn't encounter (in my opinion) the problem of headaches and motion sickness that you can get from some VR games. It's easy to play if you just want to sit back and play some VR (not having to stand, swivel, etc.) as you control the game with your line of sight and can change your direction with the R1 and L1 buttons on the remote. Very calm while still extremely immersive. It's pretty easy to lose track of time in there!

Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177481549,"People came to this game because it was unique. 

The technology of the time period, 1895, meant that action could only be deliberate and methodical. Speed was not an option. The setting built on the tension. The gentle hum of the wilderness ever present, making the groans, hacking, and wailing of the afflicted creatures dotting the landscape stand out as obstacles to your plans. Not to mention the occasional punctuation of distant gunfire (getting closer?) and panicked sounds of startled wildlife as rival hunters near. You pay close attention to the sounds of your environment with the hope that you will be more prepared for the inevitable clash with your rivals than they will be. Hearing them vault out a window for a noisy shortcut, you follow the faint sounds of their footfalls, raise your 1865 Spencer carbine, look down the sights... 

... and see Ghost Face from the 1996 film ""Scream"". His buddy has been tracking you with his beetle drone and he has led you into his trap, a magical C4 that he sets off with his new sawn-off grenade launcher.

The character of the game is being overwritten to be more like shooters with modern-day settings. The story and setting of ""Hunt"" are being erased. Sometimes even literally. The lore books in the game were entirely deleted earlier this year. 

The most generous I can be to the developers is to say that they must have been having trouble making the money to maintain ""Hunt"" as a thoroughly niche gaming experience. Didn't sustain enough income off the occasional skins to pay for salaries, maintenance, and server fees. So they had to broaden their consumer base somehow, appeal to a larger audience, if they wanted to make a profit for once. They took a lot of cues from ""Call of Duty"". They upped the pace of game-play, cut down the cycle times on guns, and added the kind of high-tech gear you would see in ""Rainbow Six: Siege"" to make the game look more exciting for a younger audience instead of limiting themselves to their small dad-game fan-base. 

But you can't succeed as a live-service game by trying to take an audience away from an existing live-service game. Ask all the ""WoW-killers"" in the graveyard of dead gaming studios how well that plan worked out for them.

This isn't even including the persisting technical issues. For example: lag is still severe and a regular occurrence. At least once every match you are going to have about 10 seconds of standing still waiting for the server to reconnect with you while you hope you don't come back to find your hunter already killed and gone forever.

There is a lot more that can be said, but as someone who has loved this game for years and had confidence that Crytek would pull through in all their challenges, I am just terribly disheartened with the changes made to the world of ""Hunt: Showdown"" this year. I was already feeling like the game I first became fascinated with was changing, trying to be something it wasn't. Still, I was recommending this game just a few months ago. 

Now the Ghost Face trailer dropped. Not only has the pace of the game been changed, but now the character of the game as well.

Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177515207,"I've been a hunt player since Jan 2019 until Aug 2024. 1896 update finally convinced me to stop and I no longer can recommend it. This is going to be less of a descriptive intro review and more of an overview of the general approach to development of the game.

Over the years the chosen approach by developers has been shifting from actual development and improvement to monetization and increasingly questionable decisions that undermined the foundation and initial concept of the game - which was the main attraction of it in the first place. The slow-paced high stakes gunplay in a dark atmospheric Wild West setting. I firmly believe that the best hunt times were in 2020 during quickswap meta, however I still think that up until the appearance of the first paid battle pass this was a good game and the devs worked well on improving it. After the first paid event battle pass it's been on a steady decline, getting worse with every update and event. 

1896 has been by far the worst update the game has ever gotten: broken engine with huge amount of various visual issues, increased pc requirements that didn't improve graphics all that much but significantly worsened performance on a lot of systems, hilariously terrible UI that is a much bigger nightmare to navigate than all the previous ones, huge conceptual loss with the removal of most existing 1st-2nd-3d Tier no-name hunters and their general replacement with the paid ones, bullet drop that nobody ever asked for. Ghostface now being by far the worst addition ever, further ruining the concept and immersion of the game. List goes on.

All of that on top of existing issues: non-stop FOMO events that cover more time in the year than the default gameplay but contain most of the (quite bad in terms of diversity and often concept) content behind paid currency, each of them introducing broken traits that devs never fix in the duration of the event, general massive orientation on paid currency that is virtually impossible to get by in-game means thanks to an amazing patch that removed them, constant releases of indentical skin dlcs that add nothing new to the existing game but get increasingly worse in quality - again ghostface is the climax of this issue now. 
Skins are optional but skins are relevant for the immersion and atmosphere, and most importantly they are quite indicative of the general attitude by devs to the game. Somehow we went from fire-themed skins with charity to ghostface.

Gameplay issues is a whole different topic too. Gameplay of the game overall is fine and tolerable but there are many topics that require adjustments: gun balance, spam gun orientation, server quality, connection issues, reconnect feature, hit registration, unpredictable damage, bullet drop, etc. So many things should've been addressed instead of the rebranded release on broken engine.  

It's kinda funny to think about that back in 2019 at the times when at the peak of the day there were 900 people playing hunt on steam it was a much more enjoyable game than it is now, with a community and developers that tried their best to improve it. And we all actually succeeded, Hunt did indeed get popular and better - for a time but not for long. Personally for me the game no longer brings neither the satisfaction, nor the enjoyment. Worst of all is the dev attitude to the game which ruins the concept. Bad concept decisions are much harder to fix than technical issues and unfortunately there's no sign of improvement in this regard. Hunt has never been mainstream and never will be purely because of its concept which is why the veteran community is quite relevant for it. In my opinion the current approach to the game leads to loss of the core part of the community that played the game since the old days. This can be fine too in a way but ultimately I cannot recommend the game anymore for anyone who is attracted to it for the same reason that I was.",ive been a hunt player since jan  until aug   update finally convinced me to stop and i no longer can recommend it this is going to be less of a descriptive intro review and more of an overview of the general approach to development of the game over the years the chosen approach by developers has been shifting from actual development and improvement to monetization and increasingly questionable decisions that undermined the foundation and initial concept of the game  which was the main attraction of it in the first place the slowpaced high stakes gunplay in a dark atmospheric wild west setting i firmly believe that the best hunt times were in  during quickswap meta however i still think that up until the appearance of the first paid battle pass this was a good game and the devs worked well on improving it after the first paid event battle pass its been on a steady decline getting worse with every update and event  has been by far the worst update the game has ever gotten broken engine with huge amount of various visual issues increased pc requirements that didnt improve graphics all that much but significantly worsened performance on a lot of systems hilariously terrible ui that is a much bigger nightmare to navigate than all the previous ones huge conceptual loss with the removal of most existing stndd tier noname hunters and their general replacement with the paid ones bullet drop that nobody ever asked for ghostface now being by far the worst addition ever further ruining the concept and immersion of the game list goes on all of that on top of existing issues nonstop fomo events that cover more time in the year than the default gameplay but contain most of the quite bad in terms of diversity and often concept content behind paid currency each of them introducing broken traits that devs never fix in the duration of the event general massive orientation on paid currency that is virtually impossible to get by ingame means thanks to an amazing patch that removed them constant releases of indentical skin dlcs that add nothing new to the existing game but get increasingly worse in quality  again ghostface is the climax of this issue now skins are optional but skins are relevant for the immersion and atmosphere and most importantly they are quite indicative of the general attitude by devs to the game somehow we went from firethemed skins with charity to ghostface gameplay issues is a whole different topic too gameplay of the game overall is fine and tolerable but there are many topics that require adjustments gun balance spam gun orientation server quality connection issues reconnect feature hit registration unpredictable damage bullet drop etc so many things shouldve been addressed instead of the rebranded release on broken engine its kinda funny to think about that back in  at the times when at the peak of the day there were  people playing hunt on steam it was a much more enjoyable game than it is now with a community and developers that tried their best to improve it and we all actually succeeded hunt did indeed get popular and better  for a time but not for long personally for me the game no longer brings neither the satisfaction nor the enjoyment worst of all is the dev attitude to the game which ruins the concept bad concept decisions are much harder to fix than technical issues and unfortunately theres no sign of improvement in this regard hunt has never been mainstream and never will be purely because of its concept which is why the veteran community is quite relevant for it in my opinion the current approach to the game leads to loss of the core part of the community that played the game since the old days this can be fine too in a way but ultimately i cannot recommend the game anymore for anyone who is attracted to it for the same reason that i was,NEU,['AA'],AA
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,178355889,"This WAS my favourite game. 
I gifted it to five different friends and recommended it to everyone who would listen.

I have never felt compelled to review a game before but the sheer disrespect of the playerbase, old and new, has been so egregious that I feel I have to speak up, if only to save a random stranger from wasting their money.

Me and my friends were incredibly excited for the update, but since then its balance, its gameplay and its community have been neglected by Crytek to the point that sometimes it's essentially unplayable.

The bugs are severe and too many to mention.
The cheaters are many and there is no way to combat them at all.
The character of the game is eroding at a rapid pace.
The stability of the game is poor.


I don't have the time or energy to describe how much has gone wrong with it.
It wasn't perfect before, but it WAS fun. The most fun I've ever had with an FPS and perhaps even with any game that I've ever played.

My love of the core makeup of the game is such that I've given it months to be fixed to a reasonably playable state again. The game does look better since the update, but it doesn't matter in the slightest as me and my friends have long since stopped having fun playing it.

This game was designed by talented people who clearly had great passion and were proud of their work and cared. 
It now wreaks of corporate misunderstanding. It is obvious that all decisions are now being made by businessmen who don't play games, don't like games, and don't care at all about their playerbase beyond our ability to fill their pockets.

Any game like Hunt Showdown does, of course, require a steady income stream to stay viable, but it is also only viable if it is enjoyable to play. As it is, I'm lucky to enjoy one out of twenty matches, and I don't even care about winning. My friends and I leave every game frustrated and angry for a myriad of reasons even if we leave with both bounties and have wiped the map of all enemy hunters.

I would have been happy to have contributed a modest monthly subscription to keep the game alive.
As the game is currently. I wish I could have my money back for all of the copies that I've bought.
Unless massive changes happen, it will simply rot in my steam library.

Whoever the new executives are have clearly pumped large sums of money into advertising, which has been effective. The playerbase has expanded massively, but this will not last. There will be a lengthy exodus, but before that happens, the executives will move on to another company, touting their success with Hunt and leaving a dead game in their wake.

This is quite literally not the game that I purchased, and I feel guilty for having clogged my friends libraries with it.

TL;DR

TRASH GAME. TRASH COMPANY 
Don't waste your money purchasing it, or your life trying to squeeze enjoyment out of it.

Pathetic.

Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,178806276,"The state of the game as of Nov 2024 is a complete joke. As someone who has been with the game since early access and have sunk just over 2000 hours into it over the past 5 years, I can't bring myself to recommend this game to anyone in its current state. The relaunch of the game in August was supposed to be a saving grace for this game, but it's felt more like the beginning of a slow death. As of the writing of this review, we are still missing two entire maps that were available to play just a few months ago. I get that they made a really cool map for the relaunch (and it is their best map), but it's crazy that there's less content in the game today than before the relaunch. 

Let's just put aside all of the asinine balancing decisions that the devs have made over the years (since they are completely subjective) and talk about the game purely from a technical perspective. A recurring theme with the game, which seems to have been exacerbated with the migration to the new engine, is the amount of game breaking/experience ruining bugs present within the game at any given time. This game deserved the amount of negativity it received upon relaunch. The fact that there was a bug that would crash your game for opening the map and it somehow made it through testing is absolute insanity. It's a core mechanic of the game. We still have instances of people crashing when entering dark sight (another core mechanic in the game) and sometimes servers will straight up just die mid-match, boot everyone out and reset everyone's progress to the start of the match.

In their most recent update post, Crytek somehow thought it would be a good idea to be candid about how hard game development is and that they may unexpectedly introduce bugs or create alterations to unintended parts of their code base when pushing through updates. This, to me, just shows that the base upon which the game is built is absolute spaghetti code and even the devs don't understand how it works fully. Let's all be completely honest and say that it's not normal for bugs that were fixed years ago to be constantly resurfacing with each update.

A lighthearted joke in the community for the entirety of the game's lifespan has been that when Crytek introduces or alters X item, it indirectly changes Y item's behavior in the game. This was most commonly referenced when players in the community noticed enemy AI and sound trap (horses, crows, ducks, etc) behaviors changing after a random balance patch. This was a meme, but Crytek has basically confirmed that this is exactly what has been happening for the past 5 years and is the reason for why the game never feels like it's in a ""fixed"" state. 

I think the only reason some veterans of the game are still playing is the unique setting/art style of the game. I'd say that the ""aesthetic"" of Hunt is carrying about 70% of this game on its back alone. So kudos to the art team in that regard. If you asked me 3 years ago, I would say that the gunplay is the most important aspect, followed by the amazing sound design, but they've been making a lot of changes to the game that has made it feel less unique compared to other shooters on the market. 

Speaking of sound design, it became objectively worse after the migration to the new engine. It's crazy that they overlooked such an important part of the game, seeing as how they previously won an award for it. Directional audio is screwed right now; it's hard to tell if someone is above, below or directly on top of you. This wasn't the case half a year ago. There are also sound cues that are either not playing properly or not triggering when they should be. Mainly enemy footsteps and throwables being prepped/cooked could just not trigger for you. My guess is that the geometry of the maps is somehow blocking sounds when it shouldn't be. 

Since they basically have drones (beetles), C4 (dark satchels) and Doc's Stim Pistol from R6 Siege (revive bolts), they should probably take another page out of that game's book and carry out their own ""Operation Health"" for a few months to just focus on fixing this broken-ass game. The cynical part of me thinks that they probably couldn't do it even if they poured all their resources into it, either because the engine is awful, their codebase is a mess or the devs are just not competent enough to carry it out. 

TL;DR this game is a technical mess and it's being entirely carried by how unique the gunplay is (or rather, used to be) and its art direction. If a competent competitor were to release a game with a similar aesthetic and gunplay on an engine that isn't complete garbage (yes, I know it's vitriolic, but there's a reason you don't see the Cryengine splash screen on successful games), this game would probably die within a year.",the state of the game as of nov  is a complete joke as someone who has been with the game since early access and have sunk just over  hours into it over the past  years i cant bring myself to recommend this game to anyone in its current state the relaunch of the game in august was supposed to be a saving grace for this game but its felt more like the beginning of a slow death as of the writing of this review we are still missing two entire maps that were available to play just a few months ago i get that they made a really cool map for the relaunch and it is their best map but its crazy that theres less content in the game today than before the relaunch lets just put aside all of the asinine balancing decisions that the devs have made over the years since they are completely subjective and talk about the game purely from a technical perspective a recurring theme with the game which seems to have been exacerbated with the migration to the new engine is the amount of game breakingexperience ruining bugs present within the game at any given time this game deserved the amount of negativity it received upon relaunch the fact that there was a bug that would crash your game for opening the map and it somehow made it through testing is absolute insanity its a core mechanic of the game we still have instances of people crashing when entering dark sight another core mechanic in the game and sometimes servers will straight up just die midmatch boot everyone out and reset everyones progress to the start of the match in their most recent update post crytek somehow thought it would be a good idea to be candid about how hard game development is and that they may unexpectedly introduce bugs or create alterations to unintended parts of their code base when pushing through updates this to me just shows that the base upon which the game is built is absolute spaghetti code and even the devs dont understand how it works fully lets all be completely honest and say that its not normal for bugs that were fixed years ago to be constantly resurfacing with each update a lighthearted joke in the community for the entirety of the games lifespan has been that when crytek introduces or alters x item it indirectly changes y items behavior in the game this was most commonly referenced when players in the community noticed enemy ai and sound trap horses crows ducks etc behaviors changing after a random balance patch this was a meme but crytek has basically confirmed that this is exactly what has been happening for the past  years and is the reason for why the game never feels like its in a fixed state i think the only reason some veterans of the game are still playing is the unique settingart style of the game id say that the aesthetic of hunt is carrying about  of this game on its back alone so kudos to the art team in that regard if you asked me  years ago i would say that the gunplay is the most important aspect followed by the amazing sound design but theyve been making a lot of changes to the game that has made it feel less unique compared to other shooters on the market speaking of sound design it became objectively worse after the migration to the new engine its crazy that they overlooked such an important part of the game seeing as how they previously won an award for it directional audio is screwed right now its hard to tell if someone is above below or directly on top of you this wasnt the case half a year ago there are also sound cues that are either not playing properly or not triggering when they should be mainly enemy footsteps and throwables being preppedcooked could just not trigger for you my guess is that the geometry of the maps is somehow blocking sounds when it shouldnt be since they basically have drones beetles c dark satchels and docs stim pistol from r siege revive bolts they should probably take another page out of that games book and carry out their own operation health for a few months to just focus on fixing this brokenass game the cynical part of me thinks that they probably couldnt do it even if they poured all their resources into it either because the engine is awful their codebase is a mess or the devs are just not competent enough to carry it out tldr this game is a technical mess and its being entirely carried by how unique the gunplay is or rather used to be and its art direction if a competent competitor were to release a game with a similar aesthetic and gunplay on an engine that isnt complete garbage yes i know its vitriolic but theres a reason you dont see the cryengine splash screen on successful games this game would probably die within a year,NEG,['AA'],AA

Sadly since the recent engine update, the game has worsened in performance. You can get killed by someone you just killed, up to 1 second after they hit the ground. There are so many pushing issues, all the loving and care the devs have put in the game has been removed. There was tons of lore accessible by playing, which has all been removed.
The game feels very generic since the update. Not gameplay wise, but UI and handling wise. It just lost all of its charm.

Now on top of those glaring issues, a new DLC has been announced, which absolutely doesn't fit into the game. The skin per se is not bad, it just doesn't fit in all the worldbuilding that has been done prior and seems like a lazy cash grab.

It hurts me to see one of my favourite games, if not my favourite game, spiral downwards into any generic game, loosing all of its charm and ignoring major gameplay bugs and issues.",lets start with the positives i used to suggest this game to basically everyone i knew i absolutely loved the setting the graphics the feeling of the guns and the entire premise of the game all in all this game is a great foundation but lets get to the cons sadly since the recent engine update the game has worsened in performance you can get killed by someone you just killed up to  second after they hit the ground there are so many pushing issues all the loving and care the devs have put in the game has been removed there was tons of lore accessible by playing which has all been removed the game feels very generic since the update not gameplay wise but ui and handling wise it just lost all of its charm now on top of those glaring issues a new dlc has been announced which absolutely doesnt fit into the game the skin per se is not bad it just doesnt fit in all the worldbuilding that has been done prior and seems like a lazy cash grab it hurts me to see one of my favourite games if not my favourite game spiral downwards into any generic game loosing all of its charm and ignoring major gameplay bugs and issues,NEG,['AA'],AA
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177374770,"Despite recent controversies and persisting issues, it's still a totally unique and amazing game.

I'm not a big fan of shooters, especially extraction shooters where you lose progress if you're killed on top of being defeated, but this game is much more than just a shooter, which I especially love. At least in my low MMR, even weird strategies are viable if executed right, and you're free to choose what's fun for you.

Top it off with a unique occult Wild West setting, stunning visuals, and crisp general art direction (with a new banger from Port Sulphur Band coming hot each season), and you get a game that will hook you even despite the bugs, ancient servers, and questionable UI.

More specifically, pros:

- Amazing visuals, art, and music. Overall design and art direction are on another level compared to other games of the same genre.
- Great sound design; often you rely more on sound than sight.
- Non-predatory battle passes with great content; can be completed without much grind. Rewards incentivize trying out new loadouts.
- Frequent events done in the style of the game, not as a simple cash grab; moreover, events aren't just cosmetics but add new experimental gameplay elements, which is fun.
- Extremely well-designed maps; each run you become more familiar with locations and can play better, but still find new things to learn.
- Very crisp animations and weapon design; I'm addicted to inspecting Throwing Knives.
- Good balance of PvE vs PvP: there aren't just zombies and stronger zombies, but different enemies whose abilities, AIs, and other features determine how you approach them with different loadouts and compositions.
- Extreme level of detail: muzzle velocity, dropoff range, status effect ranges, different statuses, clearing status drops the sticky/chaos bombs attached to you... simply learning this game will take a solid hundred hours, perhaps hundreds.
- Regular updates: the core concept of the game stays the same, but it's great to see new things being added. My favorite updates are Pact Traits tied to events and new maps/weather conditions.
- Proximity voice chat: while rarely relevant, sometimes allows for hilarious interactions.

And some cons:

- Bugs. They don't happen often (for me), but when they do, it's extremely frustrating as dying to a bug can invalidate 30 minutes of careful gameplay and kill off a hunter you've invested time into.
- UI issues: in-game mouse, wrong numeration of skins, incorrect blood bond acquisition, several summary pop-ups... I like the new look of the UI, but its functionality is far from perfect.
- Server issues: 800ms trade window too often results in being killed through a wall or by someone you haven't even seen yet. Extremely frustrating.
- Lack of replays/death cams: A game with such depth simply calls for a death cam or a whole-match replay; it would be very interesting and valuable to see how the fights actually happened and compare it to your perception.
- ""Skin""/Hunter implementation: overall Hunter designs are extremely great... and yet 90% of the time you're just staring at their hands. It would be great if they had more ""presence"": perhaps custom voiceovers for different hunters, or conditional things to say, include a victory screen where Hunters can be seen... something in this regard. Getting a Hunter skin for 1200 BB and just seeing the hands most of the time is a bit disappointing. But still worth it.
- Matchmaking: I'm on the lower end of MMR, but matches are still extremely imbalanced. Getting matched with 5* players as a 3* with 1-2* friends is just not fun.

Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177222239,"I want to preface this review by saying that I waited two months before posting it, giving the developers time to fix the issues I describe here. Unfortunately, they haven't, so I’m posting it now.

I used to love this game. After buying it in June 2021, I played it for over eight hours a day for the next two months. Even after that, I continued playing it regularly for the past three years. However, after the latest update, the game has become unplayable for me.

The new menus look awful and are unintuitive to navigate (they were clearly designed for consoles, disregarding the PC player base). The UI is broken—skin icons don’t match the skins themselves anymore. Additionally, skins now have different rarities, similar to Diablo or Fortnite, whereas previously, they were all simply labeled as ""legendary."" 

Another aspect that detracts from the experience is the change in weapon naming conventions. Previously, guns used a naming system that made them easy to identify, enhancing immersion. For instance, the Caldwell Conversion Uppercut clearly indicated that it was a model in the Caldwell-made Conversion pistol series, with ""Uppercut"" as the model name. It wasn’t 100% realistic, but it added to the game's atmosphere. Now, the weapon is simply called “Uppercut,” which feels out of place, as if it's from Apex Legends or Fortnite, and it breaks immersion. However, those are relatively minor issues compared to the bigger problems related to gameplay and performance.

Starting with gameplay, bullets now have a drop-off curve in addition to the old muzzle velocity, making it even harder to land hits and headshots over long distances. This change has effectively divided players into two groups: noobs like me, who only land a headshot by pure luck, and expert players who can hit your head behind a sheet of metal and a house from two compounds away. The middle group, to which I used to belong—players who could reliably headshot a stationary or straight-moving target—has now all but disappeared. These gameplay changes, along with others like the introduction of revive bolts for the hand crossbow and new shorter, faster-paced game modes for the current event, make me question the game’s identity. Is it still the slow and methodical extraction shooter I fell in love with, or just another Tarkov wannabe?

All of this aside, you can't even play the game nowadays, thanks to the new game engine, which made the graphics marginally prettier by 0.01% but reduced stability by 99%. I don’t have a weak setup (RTX 3060 Ti, 32 GB RAM, and a fast SSD); the game used to run at a stable 60 FPS on the highest settings. Now, it stutters even on the lowest settings. I can’t recommend playing this game in its current state. Wait until Crytek resolves the pressing performance and UI issues, and then decide for yourself.

In my opinion, the best thing Crytek could do is to revert the game to its state before August 2024, but I’m afraid the road they’ve taken is one of no return. As such, I think it’s time for me to bid farewell to my once favourite multiplayer game.",i want to preface this review by saying that i waited two months before posting it giving the developers time to fix the issues i describe here unfortunately they havent so im posting it now i used to love this game after buying it in june  i played it for over eight hours a day for the next two months even after that i continued playing it regularly for the past three years however after the latest update the game has become unplayable for me the new menus look awful and are unintuitive to navigate they were clearly designed for consoles disregarding the pc player base the ui is brokenskin icons dont match the skins themselves anymore additionally skins now have different rarities similar to diablo or fortnite whereas previously they were all simply labeled as legendary another aspect that detracts from the experience is the change in weapon naming conventions previously guns used a naming system that made them easy to identify enhancing immersion for instance the caldwell conversion uppercut clearly indicated that it was a model in the caldwellmade conversion pistol series with uppercut as the model name it wasnt  realistic but it added to the games atmosphere now the weapon is simply called uppercut which feels out of place as if its from apex legends or fortnite and it breaks immersion however those are relatively minor issues compared to the bigger problems related to gameplay and performance starting with gameplay bullets now have a dropoff curve in addition to the old muzzle velocity making it even harder to land hits and headshots over long distances this change has effectively divided players into two groups noobs like me who only land a headshot by pure luck and expert players who can hit your head behind a sheet of metal and a house from two compounds away the middle group to which i used to belongplayers who could reliably headshot a stationary or straightmoving targethas now all but disappeared these gameplay changes along with others like the introduction of revive bolts for the hand crossbow and new shorter fasterpaced game modes for the current event make me question the games identity is it still the slow and methodical extraction shooter i fell in love with or just another tarkov wannabe all of this aside you cant even play the game nowadays thanks to the new game engine which made the graphics marginally prettier by  but reduced stability by  i dont have a weak setup rtx  ti  gb ram and a fast ssd the game used to run at a stable  fps on the highest settings now it stutters even on the lowest settings i cant recommend playing this game in its current state wait until crytek resolves the pressing performance and ui issues and then decide for yourself in my opinion the best thing crytek could do is to revert the game to its state before august  but im afraid the road theyve taken is one of no return as such i think its time for me to bid farewell to my once favourite multiplayer game,NEU,['AA'],AA

Resident Evil 4,2050650,177421608,"I played through the original from 2005 about 7 times on the highest difficulty level.

The new title is called a remake, but many areas have been changed and familiar bosses and enemies have been used in other places, you can like that, but you don't have to. There are also one or two new settings, so some things are new and make you want to play through, that's how it should be.

The graphics and atmosphere are really very well done, in my opinion the best part of the whole series. The light and shadow effects are really impressive. The new missions like medallion shooting are also fun, which was great in the original.

The game itself has become harder, in some places it has a bit of a Dark Souls feel, because you just die without warning or enemies that used to come slowly (Regenerador) now come crawling and jump at you, the traps are also much better laid and the game sometimes turns into work. You are also no longer invincible when you perform combat animations, many enemies no longer stop when you shoot at them and absorb many shots like a sponge. Killing enemies from behind without being noticed is a nice feature.

You can no longer kick doors in either and ammunition (if you get it) is used up again straight away because the areas are just packed with enemies, it sometimes feels like Killing Floor. You are constantly crafting ammunition and shooting.

To be completely honest, when it comes to graphics, sound and atmosphere then it is definitely Resident Evil 4 Remake, but when it comes to authentic areas, nice speed runs or relaxed gaming then definitely the original. I see the remake more as a parallel game to the original. I like them both.

Now for the negative point, what I didn't like so much: In the original, the Separate Ways expansion was included for free, in the remake you have to shell out extra money for it, and 2 weapons or costumes that aren't available in the game can only be obtained via microtransactions, so here again they want to really cash in and milk the player. Keyword: Fear of missing out (FOMO). And then there are special suitcases or talismans that make the game easier because you get more resources, money or buy special upgrades. Microtransactions in a single-player game? I think that's really stupid.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,178484744,"Just disappointed over how weird the whole experience felt. For starters, the screen teared like mad and went black when I booted up the game. Updating my hardware didn't help either so I had to google a solution for a game startup in 2024. Managed to adjust settings by forcing windowed mode and setting fixed fps rate  to make it even playable, but my God is it a far cry from the original. If the 2005 release was a bit janky at times, then this is next level. Enemies keep clipping through Leon's model and their melee hitboxes are wider than my dreams, not to mention the controls feel super clunky with  the camera being glued right into the back of Leon's skull, limiting view severely. 

Despite maxing out the aim and general camera sensitivity, it doesn't feel like they're following along properly even on mouse and keyboard. Maybe I'm just getting old, but being forced to parry attacks with a knife in a RE game doesn't feel right, when you have one that is. Mine broke before I cleared the intro scene in village main square and I was left bummed out by the lack of everything by the end of it. I don't see myself playing this ever again, which is a real shame because I enjoyed the old RE4 quite a bit back in the PS2 era, and I was curious on how they'd tackle a classic like this.

As an OG player who managed to snag the game on Steam before it was taken off the platform, I feel lucky to have witnessed Rocket League’s growth from the ground up.

What I’ve always loved about Rocket League is the balance it strikes between being casual fun and a deeply competitive experience. You can play a relaxed game with friends or dive into ranked matches, where every goal, every save, every second counts. It’s thrilling and unpredictable and with the variety of game modes and customisation's, I’m still finding new ways to enjoy it. Nowadays, I’m mainly a casual player, but I’ve had my fair share of accomplishments in ranked play. 

One of my absolute highlights as a Rocket League fan was attending the RLCS Major in Stratford, London, at the start of 2024. Seeing top-tier players in action, meeting others who share the same love for the game and coming away with some exclusive merch—it was a memorable experience that deepened my appreciation for the community behind the game, I would love to attend more or even Worlds in the future.

If you’re looking for a game that combines fast-paced action, skill and community, Rocket League is the one to pick up. Whether you’re here for a laugh with friends or ready to climb the ranks, it’s a game that genuinely has something for everyone.

ELDEN RING,1245620,177176388,"So after completing the game more than 4 times on Steam and 2 times in seamless coop, I can confidently say this is the best open-world RPG ever made. For me, it was The Witcher 3 holding the title for years, but now we have a new Elden Lord to claim the crown, haha.

The lore in Elden Ring is something else. From the mind of R.R. Martin and direction from Miyazaki, this is not just lore but an experience of its own. From cool to mysterious to dark, every backstory of particular NPCs or bosses is different, making you want to explore more. Since I've completed the game with 100% side quests and main story guidance, it’s pretty easy to get lost in the woods or ruins if you don’t have guidance to chase the lore.

The DLC for Elden Ring is a game-changer. After diving into it, I can say it adds so much to the experience. The new areas are breathtaking, just like the main game, and the fresh challenges and bosses are a blast. The lore gets even richer, pulling you deeper into the world with new stories that make you want to explore every corner. Completing the new quests felt rewarding, like a sweet bonus for all the time I’ve spent in the Lands Between. If you loved the base game, this DLC is an absolute must-play!

Apart from the lore, the combat is challenging yet fun to mess around with, xD. It’s a typical Souls-like game, but here you get a vast open world to explore for new weapons, magic spells, incantations, and many more things to kill the dead. On top of that, every weapon or spell has its own visuals or ambient effects, which look stunning on high graphics—just like a visual novel or something. The graphics are breathtaking; the world is beautifully made and designed. From Limgrave to the nightmare called Caelid, haha, every area feels creepy yet beautiful.

In short, I’d say Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that Miyazaki-sama has done for us. Ngl, even if you’re weak or a pussy, you need to play Elden Ring once in your lifetime. Just like RDR 2, Wukong, The Witcher, and many more, it’s rare to find such a masterpiece these days that respects your time and money invested in games.

10/10 – A fucking masterpiece. Miyazaki GOAT.
",so after completing the game more than  times on steam and  times in seamless coop i can confidently say this is the best openworld rpg ever made for me it was the witcher  holding the title for years but now we have a new elden lord to claim the crown haha the lore in elden ring is something else from the mind of rr martin and direction from miyazaki this is not just lore but an experience of its own from cool to mysterious to dark every backstory of particular npcs or bosses is different making you want to explore more since ive completed the game with  side quests and main story guidance its pretty easy to get lost in the woods or ruins if you dont have guidance to chase the lore the dlc for elden ring is a gamechanger after diving into it i can say it adds so much to the experience the new areas are breathtaking just like the main game and the fresh challenges and bosses are a blast the lore gets even richer pulling you deeper into the world with new stories that make you want to explore every corner completing the new quests felt rewarding like a sweet bonus for all the time ive spent in the lands between if you loved the base game this dlc is an absolute mustplay apart from the lore the combat is challenging yet fun to mess around with xd its a typical soulslike game but here you get a vast open world to explore for new weapons magic spells incantations and many more things to kill the dead on top of that every weapon or spell has its own visuals or ambient effects which look stunning on high graphicsjust like a visual novel or something the graphics are breathtaking the world is beautifully made and designed from limgrave to the nightmare called caelid haha every area feels creepy yet beautiful in short id say elden ring isnt just a game its an experience that miyazakisama has done for us ngl even if youre weak or a pussy you need to play elden ring once in your lifetime just like rdr  wukong the witcher and many more its rare to find such a masterpiece these days that respects your time and money invested in games   a fucking masterpiece miyazaki goat,POS,['AAA'],AAA

ELDEN RING,1245620,177705224,"I'll start with the negatives (just for fun).  The lore of J.R.R. Martin's work, and it's messy, gory and perverse accordingly.  The construction of the track is catastrophic: getting from A to B is more difficult than driving on my capitol during road renovations.  The mobs are often terribly annoying and you die from them sooner than from the big bosses.  The beginning sucks because of the souls like system. Oh, and it's not a game for the physically challenged.  If only because of the lame parkour system.  I've played parkour games before (AC, Dying Light), but this one?  You want to jump somewhere and you will find it - approx.  In a 10-meter radius around him, something... or nothing and you're did...

 What is the positive in it?
 How amazingly exciting!  Addictive because of the constant dopamine rush.  There is something new around every corner, an enemy, a mystery, a loot, a catacomb, a wonderful sight, a questline, etc.  You can completely depend on it while you play, compared to it (almost) everything else seems gray.  At first you grind to have your build and to survive at all.  Then from a certain point you start to enjoy it because you already have your build and you can win in a row against enemies that you ran away from in the beginning (the Tree Sentinel is an amazing challenge at first, isn't it, and then you can survive Rykard as well).  It feels amazing! 
 Meanwhile, the landscapes sometimes look like a painting or even a nightmare, and even though Torrent has no physics, it's really fun to jump around with him.
 I have to admit, this game does something right.  Moreover, it introduces you to the world of souls like in such a way that you won't lose your interest right away, and even though it doesn't hold your hand, it is full of hidden hints and facilitations even for beginning souls like players (like me).  Not like Lies of Pi, for example, where I never even got past the apprentice boss.  Here, there is not one solution for a fight or an enemy, it depends on you, and not on the perfect parry (which depends on your fps and controller handling), where and how far you get...
 What was missing from the end was the epilogue, at least in pictures.  Because the way I saw it, almost every ending has the same ending, either you sit on the throne or that's it.  But these are only cuts of a few seconds.  Why was it not possible to show in a 1-2 minute animation what kind of change it brings to Lands Between for each ending?  With one, everything blossoms, with the other it falls into obscurity, or everyone is enough, etc.  It would probably have been graphically difficult to solve, since even after the ending you can go back and wander around and everything, but I would have liked a more epic sequence of scenes at the end, especially since everyone puts in 100-200 hours, a longer conclusion would be appropriate.

 PS: for beginners, a good guide (and maybe some help from a friend) is definitely highly recommended, without it you'll die within 5 minutes and really just get frustrated!

 P.S. I finished it in the meantime, and it's a huge bummer, because I never would have thought that about myself!  What about me and soulslike?!  But I did it, and I'm very happy about it!

a masterpiece. The gameplay is that perfect mix of strategy and adventure like chess but with dragons, wizards, and a ton of lore to keep you hooked. The game throws you into a world called Erathia, where mythical creatures, heroes, and villains clash for control. Each faction has its own vibe like the undead Necropolis or the mystical Tower, and trust me, you'll feel it when you dive in. The lore? It's deep and dramatic, with rivalries, alliances, and betrayals. Basically, it’s Game of Thrones, but in the 90s.

You build up towns, recruit armies, and explore crazy landscapes, all while getting wrapped up in quests that bring the story to life. Every hero you level up feels epic, like watching your favorite character finally get their big moment. And the HD update? Looks good while keeping that old-school charm intact.

If you’re into strategy, world building, or just want a game with endless replayability, this one’s a legend. Play it, live it, and get ready to lose track of time.

Enshrouded,1203620,178464328,"    Enshrouded, in short, is almost everything you could want from an RPG/Builder hybrid. It has some of the best building systems i've ever seen. This is where the game really shines. With recent update you even have people and animals to make your towns feel alive. 
   
    The combat is pretty decent. Nothing really new here but that isn't a bad thing in this case. 

    The talent tree is not too deep nor too simple, meaning you probably won't have to research your choices to be effective at what you want to be while also not being able to fill the entire tree making you have to make choices but also forgiving with the ability to reallocate your points. 

     The area where the game still needs the most work is the RPG/Story aspect. The story isn't bad, there just isnt much of it, or lore/history to uncover but the game is still in EA so still time to improve. 

     Character creator is abysmal for 2024. Please devs work on this.

     Though not perfect, Enshrouded is already a great game that gets better every update, a great value even at full price, and an absolute steal when on sale. 8/10 at the time of this review",enshrouded in short is almost everything you could want from an rpgbuilder hybrid it has some of the best building systems ive ever seen this is where the game really shines with recent update you even have people and animals to make your towns feel alive the combat is pretty decent nothing really new here but that isnt a bad thing in this case the talent tree is not too deep nor too simple meaning you probably wont have to research your choices to be effective at what you want to be while also not being able to fill the entire tree making you have to make choices but also forgiving with the ability to reallocate your points the area where the game still needs the most work is the rpgstory aspect the story isnt bad there just isnt much of it or lorehistory to uncover but the game is still in ea so still time to improve character creator is abysmal for  please devs work on this though not perfect enshrouded is already a great game that gets better every update a great value even at full price and an absolute steal when on sale  at the time of this review,POS,['Indie'],Indie

Enshrouded,1203620,178740899,"Honestly? 9/10. $30 for this game is fucking insane to me, it's well worth more. Tldr below.

Enshrouded is incredible. Gameplay reminds me of Fable, the 2024 edition, but with crafting. Coming from Valheim and Medieval/Sengoku Dynasty - games I enjoyed but never felt true ""satisfaction"" (always felt like something was missing or overly complex) - Enshrouded checks boxes. Nearly all of them. 

Enshrouded in its initial release form was *Good*. Now, it is *powerfully* good. I am a survival crafting noob, I dont buy into hardcore survival sims that require extensive wiki's and google docs to figure out basic recipes and how to avoid starvation. Enshrouded figured itself out, the formula just works whether you're hardcore or casual. 

With the recent additions in November 2024, adding an insanely MASSIVE zone to the already massive map and QOL updates as well as aesthetic bonuses, the only thing selling this game short is its lack of Medieval Dynasty's town NPC population and lack of guidance regarding how to acquire some recipes. There are numerous difficulty options to cater your experience towards combat focused or crafting focused. Venture into a cave and only face 1 or 2 enemies (or none at all) - or dial it up and face 50 with extra health/dmg/etc.

Finish your first adventure, return home and build the ugliest or coziest mansion on a giant property of your choice. I opted to increase gathering yield so I can hop into building faster, with slightly harder enemies in higher counts - it's perfect. You can build and craft *anywhere* - and the intuitive creative nature of the building system is top notch. Items meld and morph into each other, creating new shapes and structures you couldn't do by default. The game encourages experimentation, build a Lord of the Rings castle or an old school Japanese mansion or both. Among *many many many* other styles. 

The combat is simple enough, but more in depth than Valheim by far. The skill tree is a simplified version of PoE. Battlemage, Tank, Ranger, Paladin, among many other styles. 

It also has the potential to play on a potato based on my past experience with the initial release version. I've since upgraded and the game is gorgeous at max quality. I just sat atop a mountain and played music for half an hour for no reason at all than the satisfying aesthetic. 

My complaint: home bases feel slightly too empty. Many of us were looking forward to the ""Townsfolk"" update, assuming we would be able to populate our home bases with commoners/villagers etc. It's the reason I initially quit. I loved crafting and fighting, but I felt alone. Then the Nov 2024 update for Townsfolk turned out to be just an addition to the *crafter* NPCs you can place in your base. Unlike Medieval/Sengoku Dynasty, where your village can have 50+ commoners roaming about, doing jobs, hanging out, etc.

Tldr: Beautiful game, insane amount of content, express your inner adventurer or crafter. Devs care. 10x better than it was at release. Home bases still feel a little lonely, Townsfolk update wasn't what many of us expected. Still, more than worth the price, I wouldve gladly paid $60+.",honestly   for this game is fucking insane to me its well worth more tldr below enshrouded is incredible gameplay reminds me of fable the  edition but with crafting coming from valheim and medievalsengoku dynasty  games i enjoyed but never felt true satisfaction always felt like something was missing or overly complex  enshrouded checks boxes nearly all of them enshrouded in its initial release form was good now it is powerfully good i am a survival crafting noob i dont buy into hardcore survival sims that require extensive wikis and google docs to figure out basic recipes and how to avoid starvation enshrouded figured itself out the formula just works whether youre hardcore or casual with the recent additions in november  adding an insanely massive zone to the already massive map and qol updates as well as aesthetic bonuses the only thing selling this game short is its lack of medieval dynastys town npc population and lack of guidance regarding how to acquire some recipes there are numerous difficulty options to cater your experience towards combat focused or crafting focused venture into a cave and only face  or  enemies or none at all  or dial it up and face  with extra healthdmgetc finish your first adventure return home and build the ugliest or coziest mansion on a giant property of your choice i opted to increase gathering yield so i can hop into building faster with slightly harder enemies in higher counts  its perfect you can build and craft anywhere  and the intuitive creative nature of the building system is top notch items meld and morph into each other creating new shapes and structures you couldnt do by default the game encourages experimentation build a lord of the rings castle or an old school japanese mansion or both among many many many other styles the combat is simple enough but more in depth than valheim by far the skill tree is a simplified version of poe battlemage tank ranger paladin among many other styles it also has the potential to play on a potato based on my past experience with the initial release version ive since upgraded and the game is gorgeous at max quality i just sat atop a mountain and played music for half an hour for no reason at all than the satisfying aesthetic my complaint home bases feel slightly too empty many of us were looking forward to the townsfolk update assuming we would be able to populate our home bases with commonersvillagers etc its the reason i initially quit i loved crafting and fighting but i felt alone then the nov  update for townsfolk turned out to be just an addition to the crafter npcs you can place in your base unlike medievalsengoku dynasty where your village can have  commoners roaming about doing jobs hanging out etc tldr beautiful game insane amount of content express your inner adventurer or crafter devs care x better than it was at release home bases still feel a little lonely townsfolk update wasnt what many of us expected still more than worth the price i wouldve gladly paid ,POS,['Indie'],Indie

Enshrouded,1203620,178552102,"Devs communication is 10/10. Game updates frequently towards the player feedback.
The game feels like if budget Zelda: BoTW met with Valheim; meaning it's action RPG with crafting and base building. Core gameplay is exploring the world, finding NPCs, recieving quests from them and building a base. Don't expect much from the ""Survival"" label, the game is focused more on the RPG side than the survival one.

Exploration is the best, the game rewards you for every bit of curiosity.
Combat is okay (not great, not terrible).
Base building provides you huge freedom which is a bit overwhelming, but if you get into it you can build some crazy, detailed and (possibly) beautiful stuff.
There is some story provided by the NPCs or by books; not the main focus of the game but it's decent when you take your time and read some of those.

There are, however, some bad things; bugs, optimalization issues, weird item/skill description.. But the game is keep changing and things are getting fixed or updated.

I used to experience lots of crashes but I fixed it by turning OFF the V-Sync and lowering most of the graphical settings from high to medium. Since then the game runs smoothly.

Enshrouded,1203620,178807050,"This is easily the worst open-world survival-craft game I've played. The ""open world"" part is correct, but neither the ""survival"" or ""craft"" part is. This is closer to a Breath Of The Wild retelling from a studio who never played Breath Of The Wild, but rather, heard their big brother talk about it.

It has Conan Exiles' combat system, but without the variety of weapons, heavy attacks, or combat options. Magic is only damage and heals, so it's rather dull and painful to play with. Projectiles are slow enough to make it hard as hell to hit a moving target, and wands just about can't hit anything at all. The game's auto-targeting is worthy of memes, where hitting the enemy you want to hit (or an explosive barrel) is the hardest part of the game.

The crafting system is atrocious. You can't craft much of anything that has a purpose, and new crafts come slowly. The gear you can craft falls way behind what you'll find in the world--and there isn't any variety in the gear that you can craft. I hope you want a low-level sword or a fire wand, or low-level leather armor, because that's all you're getting for the first 31 hours.

Minecraft has a wider selection of potions. The cooking system is Valheim's, but dumbed down so much that you can completely ignore it and not notice a difference--aside from water that regens your stamina or berries that regen your health. I don't know how the farming system is, because in my 31 hours I never needed it. All of your food items will come from the world as you explore or fight, and you're going to have more food than you'll ever need.

The way you get new gear is horrible. Like I said above, you don't craft your gear. Rather, you find it in the world. Enemies drop some slight upgrades, or you farm glowing chests for serious upgrades. Here's how you upgrade you gear: you explore until you find a golden chest. Then you build a spawn point next to it, loot the chest, quit the game, log back in, and loot the chest again. Do that for an hour until all your gear is awesome. After you gain some levels, find a golden chest in a higher-level area and do it all over again. Your'e not crafting shite.

I've heard that the building system is just about best-in-class, but after 31 hours, I haven't built a single structure. There's no need to, except for ""it's fun and that's what I want to do."" The world is littered with prebuilt structures, which include a whole lot of villages and mansions. Most people just take over one of these. And with the way that bases work, you have no need to ever build outposts or a second base. You build one base, and your others are just fast-travel points. I'm really big into base-building, but I just had zero desire to do it here. There's no need to, since everything is just given to you.

The game is easy. Death is meaningless, and is barely an inconvenience. A lot of places have respawn points right outside the hard fights, so you can freely face-roll the hard fights while standing on a pile of your own corpses. Even though the game is generally easy, the combat is so bad that it makes things hard when you're facing more than one opponent. You just don't have shite for combat options. You can swing your sword and hit every enemy around you, or you can shoot a couple of fireballs out of your staff before you're out of mana, or you can use any other option and hit one guy at a time. Blocking and parrying is only meant for one-on-one encounters, and blocking more than one dude quickly burns all your stamina or gets you stunned. If you're a mage or archer, all that dodge-rolling you're going to do will burn your stamina even faster. Again, you have no options except for ""attack"", ""spend a large chunk of stamina to roll away from one attack,"" ""spend all of your mana to kill two guys with fireballs,"" or ""fail at parrying because you'll never get used to parrying something that isn't attacking.""

You have a grappling hook, which sounded really cool, but you can only use it on a handful of certain points in the world. It isn't free to use anywhere. There's an upgrade in your skill tree that lets you use it to pull flying enemies to the ground, which is nice. If the grappling hook were removed from the game in the next patch, no one would notice.

I wish I could get a refund, but it's a bit late for that. To be fair, I had fun while I was getting the hang of the game. Once I got the hang of it, I spent 20 hours trying to force myself to play it, so as to justify the money I spent on it. The map is huge and I've only explored a third of it, but I have no desire to see what the rest of it looks like. You'd only explore it to see what it looks like, because nothing you're going to do in that area is enjoyable.",this is easily the worst openworld survivalcraft game ive played the open world part is correct but neither the survival or craft part is this is closer to a breath of the wild retelling from a studio who never played breath of the wild but rather heard their big brother talk about it it has conan exiles combat system but without the variety of weapons heavy attacks or combat options magic is only damage and heals so its rather dull and painful to play with projectiles are slow enough to make it hard as hell to hit a moving target and wands just about cant hit anything at all the games autotargeting is worthy of memes where hitting the enemy you want to hit or an explosive barrel is the hardest part of the game the crafting system is atrocious you cant craft much of anything that has a purpose and new crafts come slowly the gear you can craft falls way behind what youll find in the worldand there isnt any variety in the gear that you can craft i hope you want a lowlevel sword or a fire wand or lowlevel leather armor because thats all youre getting for the first  hours minecraft has a wider selection of potions the cooking system is valheims but dumbed down so much that you can completely ignore it and not notice a differenceaside from water that regens your stamina or berries that regen your health i dont know how the farming system is because in my  hours i never needed it all of your food items will come from the world as you explore or fight and youre going to have more food than youll ever need the way you get new gear is horrible like i said above you dont craft your gear rather you find it in the world enemies drop some slight upgrades or you farm glowing chests for serious upgrades heres how you upgrade you gear you explore until you find a golden chest then you build a spawn point next to it loot the chest quit the game log back in and loot the chest again do that for an hour until all your gear is awesome after you gain some levels find a golden chest in a higherlevel area and do it all over again youre not crafting shite ive heard that the building system is just about bestinclass but after  hours i havent built a single structure theres no need to except for its fun and thats what i want to do the world is littered with prebuilt structures which include a whole lot of villages and mansions most people just take over one of these and with the way that bases work you have no need to ever build outposts or a second base you build one base and your others are just fasttravel points im really big into basebuilding but i just had zero desire to do it here theres no need to since everything is just given to you the game is easy death is meaningless and is barely an inconvenience a lot of places have respawn points right outside the hard fights so you can freely faceroll the hard fights while standing on a pile of your own corpses even though the game is generally easy the combat is so bad that it makes things hard when youre facing more than one opponent you just dont have shite for combat options you can swing your sword and hit every enemy around you or you can shoot a couple of fireballs out of your staff before youre out of mana or you can use any other option and hit one guy at a time blocking and parrying is only meant for oneonone encounters and blocking more than one dude quickly burns all your stamina or gets you stunned if youre a mage or archer all that dodgerolling youre going to do will burn your stamina even faster again you have no options except for attack spend a large chunk of stamina to roll away from one attack spend all of your mana to kill two guys with fireballs or fail at parrying because youll never get used to parrying something that isnt attacking you have a grappling hook which sounded really cool but you can only use it on a handful of certain points in the world it isnt free to use anywhere theres an upgrade in your skill tree that lets you use it to pull flying enemies to the ground which is nice if the grappling hook were removed from the game in the next patch no one would notice i wish i could get a refund but its a bit late for that to be fair i had fun while i was getting the hang of the game once i got the hang of it i spent  hours trying to force myself to play it so as to justify the money i spent on it the map is huge and ive only explored a third of it but i have no desire to see what the rest of it looks like youd only explore it to see what it looks like because nothing youre going to do in that area is enjoyable,NEG,['Indie'],Indie

They're releasing too many DLC and they sell them for like 10€ the cheapest, some are at 30€...
I paid my game 60€ and i bought 50€ worth of DLC already last year. I realised today that if i want to play the full game i'd have to pay 70€ more for DLCs adding mecanics and cultures PLUS another full 70€ for a full cosmetic pack.

The game already costs 180€ + 70€ of cosmetic detailing cultures even more.

Phasmophobia,739630,178582358,"[h1] This is what happens when an indie dev doesn't listen to the community and applies favoritism [/h1]

I started playing this game a few months after the release and i really loved it. But after hiring new staff it slowly became worse with each update, i'll list what are, in my opinion, the main issues with this game:

[b] Balancement and grinding [/b] : More than an year ago the game got reset because of an update featuring tiered items, the problem with that was that you needed dozens of hours to basically go back to what you where already using before the update, and each update after that made the grinding for these items slower and slower, basically making the new player experience unbearable. At the same time it became a lot more difficult because they made the ghost abilities much more confusing and pushing for looping the ghost around tables instead of finding hiding spots or anyway trying to stay away from the ghost.

[b] Community and content creators [/b] : Because of the grind most of the casual players were pushed away from the game, and the remaining part of the community became an elitist mess who discarded every type of criticism and just told to new players to ""get gud"" when they said something against the confusing gameplay loop or about the ghost abilities that did not praise the developers or the game. Meanwhile thanks to some youtubers and QA testers it was discovered that the developers themselves only listened to their close friends instead of the community as whole, they allowed some official content creators to abuse game bugs to have an advantage and reacted poorly to the criticism of each one who wasn't their friend.

[b] Lack of updates and shortage of staff [/b] : The game sold a lot of copies but the main developer never hired more than 3-4 people because he said i wanted to keep his ""vision""of the game, the game though suffered a lot as a result because of the extremely long time between each content update, at the moment between the two newest content updates has passed more than 1 year and recently we only got a poor Halloween event and the console release that if they don't hire more stuff, will mean an even slower development of new content, as is said though, the main developer is too stubborn to hire new stuff and to listen to the part of the community that criticizes the game.


All things considered this game is on a collision course with a really sad ending, that it could only be prevented by developers and community listening to each other, but i don't have much hope that it will happen. 

I want to thank you if you read my review and i hope i helped you in deciding if you want to buy the game or not, i'll write a small TL:DR on the bottom.


TL:DR: The game is not user friendly, requires a lot of grinding to get the best items and the developer don't listen to the community and make blatant favoritism.

Throne and Liberty,2429640,176948130,"So, after over 180 hours of play time and experiencing everything this game has to offer up to my servers milestones point, I think its time to give my 2 cents on this game. Usually, I don't care to review games, not worth my time, but I can't stand people who defend this game as if its the next best thing to pizza.

Is the game fun? Fun, is subjective, but to me the whole process of reaching the endgame, completing all codex entries before moving onto the next zone, was fun for what it was. Reaching endgame, the ""fun"" disappeared and you get what other MMO's have, DAILIES. Now you don't really have dailies, but you have a daily loop of things you do in order to not fall behind in content, and its a soulless experience. There is literally nothing to do outside of these dailies, almost similar to what Lost Ark was like, except the combat in Lost Ark made it somewhat bearable. The daily loop is basically: 3 dungeons, 10 contract quests, using up open world dungeon tokens, and attending world boss events(some of which are pvp contested). As for the stuff like guild missions and world events? Almost pointless to do since you'll still get guild currency for not even doing any missions and world events literally have no value outside of doing them for guild missions.

PvP is hot garbage in this game. Gear+Build > Skills, doesn't matter how good you are at your class, if you aren't playing meta builds with the best and maxed out gear, you aren't beating others who are meta and have better gear. You also will die if stunned in this game by another player, and let me tell you, there is no cooldown in between you getting stunned so you can die without being able to do anything. Throne and Liberty is also known by another name ""Tanks and Liberty"", and you will see a bunch of pvp players with 15k+ hit points that never die while being in decent gear, now imagine if they get the best gear.

P2W, lets not sugarcoat it as P2Progress. I'll be honest and say I spent some money to buy upgrades, so I can give you an idea of what money can get you. You can use your daily contracts for things like parchment or crafting stones instead of weapon/armor growth stones, since you can buy those materials with real money, thereby allowing you to gear faster. You can buy purple gear, some of which are best in slot, instead of farming for them via rng, or pity crafting. You can buy ""traits"" and max them out, which is why you see players who aren't tanks, that have over 12k hit points while the average player has 6 to 8k with the ""max hp"" trait. You can also pay guilds to give you loot drops from world bosses, because guilds change how loot works, and your boss loot goes into guild storage where the leader can give it to other players as well. To all the P2W deniers, this is a PvP game with PvE content, and unless you as someone who doesn't spend money can beat a 3100 CP player with video proof - you're in denial.

The community. Its honestly already starting to look toxic, much sooner than Lost Ark showed its toxicity. You already have gatekeeping groups for PvE content, and good luck trying to get into any good guild unless you have extremely high CP and with the correct viable builds(So none of you players with Greatsword/Wand, SwordShield/Staff, etc). You can join a casual guild, but this is a PvP game, not made for casuals.

I don't recommend this game to anyone who values their time or money.

There's a basically a cap that you can get to in terms of power. For the most part, you can get to that cap as a F2P player. It may take you a few weeks to maybe a month of consistent playing while the whales can do it in 20 minutes of swiping, but you can get there.

Once you DO get there, you're even with them. It's not like they can $$$$$ into infinity so you can never catch them, it just takes time playing the game. In my opinion playing the game because it's fun to do is the whole point, so don't worry about when you get there.

Throne and Liberty,2429640,177073879,"The single player story feels condensed at best.  They introduce characters/storylines that you are supposed to care about, then you kill them off two missions later.  Powerful demon who has been around for centuries?  I killed him off the same mission I learned about him... Other powerful demon?  Only a mission or two more.  The big bad?  A mission or two after I met him.  So I definitely wouldn't recommend the game for the story.

Gameplay is fine, except you are limited to two characters, it is a pain to switch weapons if you change your mind, and a bunch of stuff (e.g. the battlepass) is CHARACTER and not account bound.  Once you finish the story it becomes about a ridiculous grind, and you can screw yourself over if you don't know various tricks (e.g. don't immediately transfer your blue weapon into a purple weapon, apparently is better to wait to save growthstones) or make poor choices.

The morphing doesn't really add anything, it is just the equivalent of sprint.  The glide morph is incredibly frustrating.  You can only glide and not fly, you go less distance if you can altitude, you will unmorph if you hit a branch or other minor obstacle, and you will randomly nosedive into the ground.  It just feels bad in every respect.

PvP is a stunlock zergfest.  I didn't sense any real opportunity for strategy or even real combat.  Maybe is better if you focus solely on PvP with your build, e.g. choosing the correct weapons and the correct skills at creation, but that requires foreknowledge.  If you just try to play the game good luck, it won't be fun.

Definitely feels like there are meta 'correct' choices for weapons and skills for various activities.  Want to compete in world events and PvP?  Good luck...

Maybe I have been out of MMOs for too long, but the dungeons are just tedious rather than challenging.  Numerous instant kill 'mechanics' that you need to be aware of in advance to create faux challenge.  Doing the same thing every two minutes to avoid instant death is not a fun or challenging boss, it's just annoying especially if you dare play with a PUG.  

Various gacha/mobile style time gates.  You can't run as many dungeons as you want, only X number, you can't do as many contracts as you want, just X number, you only get X abyssal coins, you only can by X eggs/honeys, etc.

The store is ridiculously overpriced.  And a real money auction house is obnoxious.  I don't know what is more ridiculous, that I sold a world boss drop for the equivalent of $100, or that they 'taxed' the equivalent of $20 of a currency that you have to buy from them.  This might tie into other mechanics, but will only reward the top whale/zerg guilds if it does.

Throne and Liberty,2429640,178276786,"TL;DR: Try it out since its free but be aware of the honeymoon phase the game is still in right now. Solid game on the surface, getting worse the deeper you get. You are forced into one build (two weapons) and preferably one or two at most skill preset(s) and will have to stick on it due to how punishing rerolling weapons is.

-Leveling: is ok, nothing special but its kind of fast compared to other mmos

-Combat: is uninspired button smashing, you do your ""opener"" once and then just smash the button that comes off of cooldown for PVE and PVP in smallscale (arena) is just who stuns who first and just die. Largescale is like every other large scale mmo about shotcalling, numbers on members and some coordination. If youre seeking for class complexity this is the wrong game for you.

-Graphics: very good to be fair

-Community: depends, my server was partially extremely toxic enviroment between top guilds and between top guilds and the rest of the server. I personally dont have a problem with toxicity and was bm'ing aswell sometimes but if you're sensitive it may be not for you. so yes I was part of the problem but its an asian pvp mmo so its nothing new.

-Daily loop: absolute cancer in my eyes and I am sorry for these words but I cant find any other for that. If you played lost ark its basically the same. everything is timegated but on top of that you are forced to do the daily stuff otherwise you will be capped on ressources after a few days. Not for me. Another comparison if you played BDO: its like agris fever which will fill up daily up to a maximum but in TnL you dont have 1 system like that, no you have 2 of them plus one ressource that stacks up when you use one of the other ones. Wasnt for me, i stopped doing daily shit after getting my build ready. this plus the other activities that will come across for you when youre joining a competitive pvp guild (conflict bosses, pvp events, rift/boonstone wars) it just felt like a 2nd job and if you really want to min max everything and getting to a high rank in the ranking system you basically have to be unemployed)

-Monetization: In short: LOL. Full: I dont recommend swiping at all, their prices are predatory for the amount of worth you get out of it. thats why they immediately banned RMT with draconic punishment (they basically took away the lucent you bought illegally and force you to buy the amount youre in negative to use the auction house again). Which is fine but they should ask themselves why ppl instantly started RMT that much, because its completly not reasonable. Its like buying currency on a mobile game, it just feels off and you feel robbed. I didnt RMT personally but still have the opinion that they shouldnt be surprised that this would happen.

-Misc: There are techniques and hidden knowledge for the systems in the game that are recommended to know in my opinion. When EA started it forced many players (me included) to restart on a fresh character because it just wasnt worth to continue on the first one. So I strongly recommend to do your research because the game is very punishing when doing mistakes.

My conclusion is that it was somewhat fun for nearly 300 hours now but uninstalling was followed by a big relief.

Throne and Liberty,2429640,177608525,"Graphics 9/10 - RTX 4090 semi-daily memory leaks even with different GPU, MB, Memory
Main Story: 7/10 - Mid-budget Korean level storytelling with little cut scenes character development, etc
PvE Combat: 8/10 - Standard tab-target feels like other developer MMO movement (Rift) Combat is fluid
PvP Combat: 8/10 - Combat is fluid with hard counter classes and emergency skills, but IRL purchases have caused a massive imbalance that gate keeps normal players from having a chance.

Pros: Game world is large, 8 leveling dungeons with end game versions of them, lots of timer based world events, open world dungeons for grinding, open world bosses, guild vs guild content, weekly/daily quests, cooking, fishing, crafting, and Auction House

The game is being released in ""phases"" so not ALL content is accessible, giving each server player base a chance to go through content in a reasonable pace, preventing gaming locusts and 24/7 no lives from rushing through content. Since the game is completely focused on Guild Vs Guild PvP, the phased release is needed for guild players to have an even playing field for leveling and content consumption. It also makes sure the community of $$$ swipers will have a much even pace, and spend even MORE IRL purchases on gear, since no one can rush to the very end game gear and sell it...yet

Cons: Auction house is completely in real-world money, and has completely destroyed the game with large guilds of IRL purchasers maxing their characters way past anything achievable other than a 24/7 F2P player with supporting buffed up guild. These guilds lock people out of world boss content in two ways:

1. World bosses spawn with open world PvP active and your character can get deleted in 1-2 hits, plus the boss can kill you in 1-2 hits. 90% of the time when world bosses spawn they go untouched
2. World bosses spawn with NON-PvP active and everyone attacks, deleting the boss in a few minutes but rare gear reward drops based off of performance, so IRL purchasers again get all the loot and sell in on auction house for HUGE IRL prices, which bumps up the price of what everyone else is selling, leading to AH gear prices to astronomical costs (think Star Citizen ship sales levels)

3. Once you've completed the initial campaign and completed the dungeons that's all the content for PvE players, except for grinding till your eyeballs bleed for small chance rare gear drops. However, the amount of times you can run dungeons each week is arbitrarily gated by dungeon currency needed to open boss chests
4. Guild leaders get world boss loot drops, NOT the guildies and they often times (most toxic) take it for themselves and their ALT characters, or (least toxic) prefer to give drops to their friends or ransom the loot drop for a ""guild auction"" to get money from the players.

5. Server dungeon queues often demand INSANE gear scores for even the starter end game dungeons because of all the IRL purchasers and early access players, leaving new players or casual players out in the cold and ""request to join group denied"" if they have normal gear level for those dungeons where they NEED the loot drops from those dungeons to gain higher gear score.",graphics   rtx  semidaily memory leaks even with different gpu mb memory main story   midbudget korean level storytelling with little cut scenes character development etc pve combat   standard tabtarget feels like other developer mmo movement rift combat is fluid pvp combat   combat is fluid with hard counter classes and emergency skills but irl purchases have caused a massive imbalance that gate keeps normal players from having a chance pros game world is large  leveling dungeons with end game versions of them lots of timer based world events open world dungeons for grinding open world bosses guild vs guild content weeklydaily quests cooking fishing crafting and auction house the game is being released in phases so not all content is accessible giving each server player base a chance to go through content in a reasonable pace preventing gaming locusts and  no lives from rushing through content since the game is completely focused on guild vs guild pvp the phased release is needed for guild players to have an even playing field for leveling and content consumption it also makes sure the community of  swipers will have a much even pace and spend even more irl purchases on gear since no one can rush to the very end game gear and sell ityet cons auction house is completely in realworld money and has completely destroyed the game with large guilds of irl purchasers maxing their characters way past anything achievable other than a  fp player with supporting buffed up guild these guilds lock people out of world boss content in two ways  world bosses spawn with open world pvp active and your character can get deleted in  hits plus the boss can kill you in  hits  of the time when world bosses spawn they go untouched  world bosses spawn with nonpvp active and everyone attacks deleting the boss in a few minutes but rare gear reward drops based off of performance so irl purchasers again get all the loot and sell in on auction house for huge irl prices which bumps up the price of what everyone else is selling leading to ah gear prices to astronomical costs think star citizen ship sales levels  once youve completed the initial campaign and completed the dungeons thats all the content for pve players except for grinding till your eyeballs bleed for small chance rare gear drops however the amount of times you can run dungeons each week is arbitrarily gated by dungeon currency needed to open boss chests  guild leaders get world boss loot drops not the guildies and they often times most toxic take it for themselves and their alt characters or least toxic prefer to give drops to their friends or ransom the loot drop for a guild auction to get money from the players  server dungeon queues often demand insane gear scores for even the starter end game dungeons because of all the irl purchasers and early access players leaving new players or casual players out in the cold and request to join group denied if they have normal gear level for those dungeons where they need the loot drops from those dungeons to gain higher gear score,NEG,"['Unknown', 'Indie']",Multiple

just not for me

on the plus side the graphics are good and the servers appear to be largely solid as a rock with good response times

now the negative side

its a conversion from a Korean game, the main story is rubbish and your character appears to be mute as it doesn't actually utter one audible word just gestures with hands 

way too many mobs in game, you quite literally cannot run anywhere without some low level mob giving you aggro including flying over their heads 100 feet in the air

bots did i mention bots, trains of bots killing mobs and gathering and killing mobs, trains of them, folks were saying how can this be its a new mmo without realising its a convert from its Korean original so yes all ready set up just like Lost Ark was

crafting lol what crafting lets remove one of the most important crafting items from the game to stop you from crafting blue gear as not everyone can craft purple

trade post another joke, takes ages to refresh then you need real money to buy their ingame tokens to spend there, yeah right that will work well

now the serious stuff, the combat when compared to things like Elder Scrolls is a complete and utter joke with a capital J. Why i hear you ask well, you as usual have a main hand weapon and an off hand weapon but then you have upto 12 skills available on your skills bar at the same time, no concept of switching weapon as such to switch the weapon and the skills available so your using crossbow skill whilst holding a longbow, complete trash (apart from the spinning crossbow skill that basically kills all mobs within 5m now thats a nice animation to watch) its just a button mashing job at best

after a week of the same events rotating i really didn't want to hear about the wolves hunt and what to do every couple of hours 

now don't be a tank or a healer as boss chests are at present based on damage done so kinda useless being one of those builds as you get nothing

we have the usual pro dungeon freaks must be 2k plus dps to run with me not got it then your not elite enough to be in my team 

gold sellers of course based on the afore mentioned bots and those lovely sellers offering dungeon runs so they get the drops to sell back to public

Silent Hill 2,2124490,177673713,"Yes, I played the OG when it first released in 2001, and it’s remained one of my favorites to this day. I’ve listened to the soundtrack more times than I can count. Hell, I used to listen to the game rip before bed just to relax (you know, the industrial noises that sound like “rocks banging around a washing machine”). None of that makes me an expert on the series, though, nor does it even matter. Silent Hill 2 isn’t the same game that was released in 2001. Sure, there are aspects of the original that I prefer and don’t believe can ever be fully replicated, but Silent Hill 2 is a good game. No…it’s a GREAT game! And that’s WAY more than I expected to say when it was first announced two years ago.

Silent Hill has been, and always will be, about atmosphere. These games instill a sense of dread in me that I can’t fully explain or comprehend, and that is why I constantly find myself returning to them time and again. To step back into that world for the first time in over a decade has been a dream come true! What Bloober Team was able to accomplish has finally brought me home to where my love of survival horror had all begun.

Despite my initial worries, the story remains faithful through and through, with added scenes, tweaks to conversations, and new character interactions elevating its emotional core even further. The actors are beyond fantastic. Luke Roberts adds so much depth to James Sunderland's character, he feels like a flesh and blood human being. I’ve seen comments that the performances are flat and lack the emotional poignancy of the OG, but I don't agree at all. These actors ARE the characters; you can see it in every expression, hear it in every sigh, read it in every utterance… There are moments when I know EXACTLY what a character is thinking, and they haven’t said a single word. Granted, there are a few line deliveries from the original that come off more intensely authentic, but I far and away prefer the new performances to the old, and don’t find them to be any less “dreamy” or effective. James is more than a grieving husband. Maria is more than a trampy harlot. Angela’s pain and trauma is so on display that I can’t understand how anyone can look at her and not instantly feel their heart rend in two... Eddie is, well, Eddie, but I like that he’s less a of goof and more of a ticking-time-bomb, and that works perfectly for his redesigned boss fight. 

If there’s anything that has been improved over the original, however, it’s the combat. All of the old weaponry is accounted for (save for one item, but I like what they did with it thematically), and they feel satisfying to use, especially the melee weapons. The heft of the board with nails, and later on the pipe, is palpable when you’re bashing the monsters into a bloody pulp. Granted, it’s not as thrilling as Leon S. Kennedy round-house kicking ganados, but it feels weighty and impactful, and I never really got tired of it. James’ increasingly unhinged grunts and screams as he’s bashing away at eldritch monstrosities don’t hurt either. The gunplay, while basic, is serviceable without making James feel overpowered; even while using keyboard and mouse, landing hits isn’t always a guarantee. The way the enemies move is often unpredictable and requires some finesse with the dodge button, but that’s all part of making the mechanics more engaging. James isn’t a commando, nor does he play like one, so you’ll be on your toes from start to finish, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Then there are the graphics. I’m not lying when I tell you this may be one of the best looking games I have ever played. The world design, the environmental detail, the lighting, the fog, the grime, the decay and blood and rust, it all adds to the immersion and makes me want to explore every nook and cranny ‘til I’ve uncovered all the little secrets the game has to offer. The ONLY issue I have with so much graphical fidelity is that sometimes the increased detail doesn’t allow the mind to fill in all those disgusting little cracks with even more horrific imagery. But that’s where shadow comes into play.

The darkness in Silent Hill is almost an entity in-of-itself. The way it swallows James’ surroundings, especially in the Otherworld, eliciting feelings of claustrophobic isolation…it's near perfection. I’ve never seen darkness wielded so well in a horror game. When you’re drowning in a sea of black, when not even your own flashlight burns bright enough to push back the encroaching shadows, every source of light is a welcome respite from the horror. You’ll definitely need to have ray tracing turned on to get the most out of the lighting effects, however. Without it, the dark areas are TOO dark, and you’ll be forced to increase the gamma to the point that the shadows aren’t nearly as ominous as they should be. For some, that may mean their performance gets dumped into the toilet, but if you can at least play at a stable 30 fps with RT on, I’d highly recommend it over the alternative. 

As for where the game falters, it's in the sound design. Most of the ambient sounds are remastered from the OG, but I feel part of what made the original so unsettling is that there was rawness to the “noise” that feels overproduced with the remastering. It’s like when an artist remasters an old song, it rarely has the same vibe as the original. Imperfection creates character, and taking it away doesn’t always make something better. In a game where the degradation of your surroundings is actually part of the story, losing those imperfections actually removes a bit of the horror. Then there’s the silence. The moments when James is surrounded by the complete absence of sound are few and far between, and THAT is the biggest failure in the sound design. There’s nothing like walking down a hallway and the only thing you hear are James’ footsteps echoing throughout the darkness. It not only instills a sense of loneliness in the player, but creates unease as our emotions are no longer being lead by what we hear. Now don’t get me wrong, the sound design isn't at all horrible. It WILL freak you out, especially while traversing the darker environments, doubly so if you’ve never played one of these games before, but it’s missing the eeriness of the original that I’m not sure can be recaptured, and that's a shame.

Of course, there are also the performance issues, which are difficult to get around no matter how beefy your system is. Despite upgrading specifically for this game, my RTX4080/Ryzen 9 5950x combo at 1440p was still struggling, and the stuttering and frame drops proved to be far more than mere annoyances. It took days of fiddling with settings, installing mods, and endless engine.ini manipulations to determine that none of it was really fixing anything. So I dropped the mods, switched DLSS off, turned Rebar on, cut my monitor’s refresh rate in half, and capped my fps to 60, and that gave me a smooth enough experience to truly enjoy my stay. That said, I can completely understand how the performance issues are a deal breaker for many, but even at its worst, I was still able to enjoy myself enough to overlook these technical difficulties. 

To be honest, I could probably write another half dozen paragraphs on the game (I didn’t even touch on the boss fights, symbolism, theories and new endings), but this review has gone on for far too long. Despite some minor grievances, Silent Hill 2 is a fantastic return to form for the seminal horror series, and I really, TRULY hope future games continue on this trajectory, because I want MORE. I NEED more. Whether it’s another remake, a new entry, or just more Silent Hill media in general, we need games like Silent Hill. There really isn't anything else out there quite like it, and I’m overjoyed that it’s finally back to fill the hole in my horror-loving heart.

Silent Hill 2,2124490,177106749,"[h1] Silent Hill 2, Running Through The Fog[/h1]

Silent Hill 2 (2024) is a remake of the original game that modernizes the gameplay to be less clunky while also adding more content, and endings and fixing a lot of the original's flaws. Even with all the changes, Bloober has made sure to respect the original vision and keep the essence of the game intact, as the town is as scary and unsettling as it always has been.

This remake doesn't have anything to be jealous of the Resident Evil ones, as the technical level of the game is impressive, resulting in a redemption arc for the developer, that managed to make a game of this caliber after numerous failures. 23 years later, we get the best version of the game there is as we revisit James Sunderland and Silent Hill.

[h1]What Makes It Worth Playing?[/h1]

The remake doubles the duration of the original game, lasting around 14 hours on average while the original would be around 8 hours, giving more content to enjoy and digest. The details in the game are also a nice touch, as being able to break windows of cars and stands for ammo and healing items makes you look at the scenery with more attention. Other details like Maria reacting to James' flashlight, or Eddie's breath being cold due to his version of the Otherworld being colder, are subtle but add a nice touch to the immersion.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3349313591

The game also introduces new endings, making a second playthrough more enticing, and the speedrun challenge of beating the game in less than 10 hours (which I got ;3) adds replayability to the adventure once one finishes the core of it. With the gameplay being reworked to feature a more fluid experience that packs more action and strategy regarding movement, Silent Hill 2 ends up being a remake that gets you hooked, always wanting to play ""one more area"" before putting the controller down.

[h1] Bloober Doesn't Cut Corners, Improving Upon The Original[/h1]

Bloober has improved upon the game by adding tension to it, something that the original can be missing at times. Bosses now have more room to move around, resulting in high-paced action where foes don't let you breathe. For example, Pyramid Head encounters in the original were mostly a small empty room, but in the remake, the room is bigger, has rain and there are objects James has to use to avoid being sliced by Pyramid Head, resulting in more action and strategy for the encounter. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3349314102

Puzzles have been revamped too, becoming at times a bit easier but generally harder, and answers from 23 years ago in the original won't work in the remake. In addition, each difficulty has its solutions to the puzzles that are different, and some of them even have randomly generated ones, adding to the challenge. The map no longer pauses the game either, making exploration and solving of puzzles nerve-wracking as you are in a dark corridor trying to get your beatings. Sometimes, Pyramid Head will chase the player in some area like Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, making it worse!


[h1] More Action Means More Horror[/h1]

I know some of the readers and those on the fence might be like ""More action, less scared!"" but is the opposite. By adding more enemies, there is always a sensation that something can (and will!) jump from the darkness to attack you. Being wary of the fact that foes can appear at any moment, adds tension to the atmosphere of the game! Certain areas such as Toluca Prison felt confined and crushing to me, as the entire area is dark, with timed switches that bring light for a few seconds in long corridors, and when the light goes out halfway through, the enemies will jump from everywhere, walls, ceilings, etc. The fact that Toluca Prison is a long segment makes for a more tense experience where one wants to get out of the complex ASAP. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3349314933

The sound design is so impressive that I doubt there will be a game with a better sound design in 2024. Enemies move around and noises in the background result in ""Did that come from the game or real life?"" giving more immersion. Pyramid Head dragging his big knife is something that keeps me awake at night, and some enemies make noises that are either disgusting or disturbing. Let me add real quick that finding enemies in the game is a nice detail that is tricky, the flashlight will blink when a foe is close by, but it will also count little spiders, giving a false alarm of sorts. If you have the controller on vibration mode, the rain can mimic that of enemies, resulting in the rain providing cover for them not only visually, but in gameplay as well. 

[h1]Price Point Analysis and Replayability[/h1]

For 70 bucks, you are getting your money's worth (did that rhyme? Hopefully not). The game is a technical marvel that does an excellent job when it comes to visuals, sounds, atmosphere, and gameplay, resulting in one of the best titles of the year 2024. The only thing holding the game back a bit is that we are missing the Born From a Wish Maria chapter, which could perhaps be added as a DLC, and that the game can crash, resulting in a loss of progression (especially in Lakeside, it crashes more than usual!) During my experience, I suffered 7 crashes, not a lot per se but frustrating having to redo certain segments. Oh well! I didn't crash in Toluca Prison at least, phew!

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]

To anyone who said Bloober couldn't do justice to the game, I am expecting an apology now (I jest but seriously the devs have proven themselves). The game ended up in good hands with the team, and Silent Hill 2 ended up being an improved version that is unpredictable, unnerving, and exciting! It finds a careful balance between keeping the original vision and adding new changes that reinvigorate the experience. Silent Hill 2 couldn't be in better hands, and I am hoping we get a remake of the first title, Silent Hill, with this team.

Silent Hill 2,2124490,177235087,"Silent Hill 2 Remake perhaps is the best horror game in history in terms of its atmosphere. The developers have exceeded all expectations by creating a unique and believable world. The story is told superbly and remains relevant even after 23 years.

This remake is perfect for newcomers to the series. Sometimes, it is simply impossible not to be scared of it: the sound, visuals, and plot create an incredible sense of immersion. Fans of the horror genre will definitely not be left unimpressed.

In terms of gameplay, the game is surprisingly straightforward: at the normal difficulty level, it's almost impossible to die, as there are plenty of health items and weapons. However, the challenge here lies mainly in the atmosphere, because many times you just scared of empty coridors, closed doors and etc. It's pure brilliance.

I had no real intention of buying this game or playing it. I saw a brief bit of gameplay and thought, ""ok, what the hell..."" Silent Hill 2 (Remake) is now [strike]potentially[/strike] my favorite game in the genre. The moment to moment action is engaging, eerie, and often deeply stressful.

Is everyone else psychotic? Are the events unfolding really happening? And if they are, why are they?

Silent Hill 2 is a fantastic psychological horror mystery with tremendous acting and is well worth the price of admission.

Silent Hill 2,2124490,177830147,"[h1]an incredible Remake of a masterpiece[/h1]
I've not completed the classic version in the past, but after playing this, I might now.
this is a perfect atmospheric horror game made by a studio that was its first time creating a survival horror, and they nailed it. people in Capcom need to keep their heads up because they might have a worthy competitor now.

the gameplay is good but can be better and the dodge mechanic is a little bit op and the game is a little bit easy but it doesn't affect the work of art they created with Silent Hill 2 
I love the atmosphere in this game so much that its the only reason I'm gonna beat it for the second time, and the fact that this is made in unreal engine with this level of graphics makes it even more atmospheric.
I swear I can wander in that foggy city for hours and not get tired at all.

and I don't have to say anything for the story cuz it's about the same as the classic, with some little difference and 2 new endings that adds even more things to talk about, but sadly I cant do that because you should experience it yourself.

the only thing I can say to criticize the game is that ""otherworld"" levels are a little bit frustrating, especially in Brookhaven Hospital, but that feeling of frustration faded away while visiting the next areas of the game, and I have to say I'm surprised that I didn't have any problems with the prison, it sounded like a boring level but it was okay, and even if I had any, it would've been gone by the time I reached the Lakeview hotel, that was the best area they created in this game, even better than the silent hill city, I wish I could visit a hotel like that in real life, with all those foggy and empty hallways, it gives me a feeling of unease and I kinda like that, this whole game was a big liminal space of its self, I can't believe silent hill created that feeling even before backrooms in 2001 and I missed it somehow until today

Overall, very good game, everyone should play this masterpiece

Silent Hill 2,2124490,176941068,"The remake does a surprisingly good job at capturing the ""feel"" of the original game while modernizing it in the areas that make sense to, such as the environments and the controls.

The progression through each area is slightly more linear than before, but not in a way that makes it feel particularly hand-holdy or on rails -- just in a way that makes it a little harder to get lost with no idea where you should be going next, which I actually appreciated, because I have plenty of memories of just wandering around the areas in the original game, trying every door and hoping to stumble across something I'd missed. A few areas that were a bit lacking in the original game are even improved this time around, such as the Labyrinth being a bit more fleshed-out.

Silent Hill 2,2124490,177956288,"The game is a perfect adaptation, or rather, translation of the original. The long story short it is a timeless masterpiece. It makes excellent and brilliant tweaks to adapt to modern audiences and storytelling, such as updating the graphics, enhancing the sound design, and refining the gameplay mechanics. Every chilling aspect of the original is flawlessly remade and even improved upon in some areas. The characters maintain their slightly off-putting presence and dialogue. The enemies are ruthless and unforgiving. The combat is hectic and best described as frantic. It's ugly, it's brutal, it's visceral. Every swing of a pipe and every blast from a shotgun feels like there's violent intention behind it. The story is preserved, including fan-favorite moments from the original. Some scenes are added here and there throughout to help expand upon some characters. The new models and voices for the characters do an excellent job of translating the original. There are even a few new endings added. 

The sound design is unlike ANYTHING I've heard from a video game—very subtle noises as you wander through dark corridors and it was remarkable. There are no apparent generic footsteps near you, just things that sound like they don't belong. Enough to constantly question whether it's the game or something in your room. It is brilliant. This game is winning awards on sound design alone, mark my words. The soundtrack is as great as ever, and Akira Yamaoka returned to produce it. The intro song is superb, subtly referencing Silent Hill 1's original opening. There wasn't a track that I felt was a letdown at all. There are even some tracks from the OG that return with little to no change at all. Not playing this game is a disservice to yourself. This deserves owning a physical copy. It's that good. This is a generation-defining release for the horror/survival horror genre, a game that will be remembered for years to come. I intend to say it all in the craze around this title.

Silent Hill 2,2124490,177422359,"So, I have completed a first playthrough of the game and all I can say is that my expectations were beaten. That would be a bold triumphant moment, but said expectations were extremely low, so beating them is not much of an achievement. Nevertheless, I must say that the game is surprisingly good and - what is important - clearly made by people who understood the original very well and had their own vision.

Technically speaking, changes-wise, the remake is very tame, and of the key elements they made significant changes to two characters (Maria and Eddie) and added several narrative scenes crystallizing certain traits of the players in this drama. Some changes are positive - say, it is much easier now to take Eddie's line more seriously, however endearing the original was.

Visually, we have insanely good work with surroundings - area design, deterioration in Otherworld, mud, dirt, rust, ""normal"" areas, all done incredibly well and are at the same time recognizable and authentic. Monsters also shine - not only they are true to the original, Bloober actually found a way to expand the original roster without actually expanding it. Line Figures come in three options now instead of 2, Mannikins and Nurses also have a variant with different moveset, Mandarins previously present in a single scene ([i]edit: I do need to replay the original, maybe they actually were encountered twice[/i]), now got a full compensation and rule at least three significant sections of the game, playing slightly different roles in each. Plus, modified combat mechanics and behaviour lead to developers being able to actively combine mobs, requiring the player to do the doom thing and think what tools to use at which enemy.

Combat-wise there are many questionable things. First, the combat is almost unavoidable now. You will have to kill most enemies. You technically can run past many of them, and if you clearly know what you are doing, you can reduce your fighting by half, but there still clearly are some situations that are built around assuming you go in and kill everyone. Melee combat is context-based. You auto-lock to an opponent and attack that opponent. You can dodge at any point, even attack cancel, and if you want to preserve ammo, and you do want to preserve ammo, you'll need to learn attack patterns of the mobs, which can actually get quite complicated. If you get the system, melee becomes basically easy. But it is often of use to utilise firearms in combination with melee to optimize fighting. Some mobs are better suited to be dealt with a specific weapons. Line Figures are easily headshotted with a pistol, Nurses can be one-tapped with shotgun headshots, and so on.

Stomping is also back, you can still hit the mobs when they fall, or else they can get up immediately, though it also is contextual, which sometimes leads to funny results, like not being able to break a window near a lying enemy, or stomping air instead of enemy, or stomping the wrong guy. Also killed mobs can just get up because they like you that much - it seems their getting up is sometimes scripted, sometimes timed.

Another moment is that all areas are now more structurally formulaic. In each main area you have a Main Puzzle, usually covered with some rug to make the discovery more epic, I guess. It usually is a classic or modified classic recognizable puzzle or locked object, like the coin puzzle or multi-locked box. The entire area now circles around with a few routed sections during which you gather elements needed to solve or unlock the object. This is a functional approach, but it makes overall progression more predictable and formulaic, which is not a good thing for a horror experience. Luckily, this is compensated by diversity in structures and areas, with sub-puzzles, different monster compositions, and so on.

Returning to visuals, character modeling is the weakest part of the game. Not only some characters are weirdly disproportionate (especially Maria), their meshes seem to be in the need of an additional retouch to complete them. Angela's face seems to change from scene to scene, for example. Eddie is so grotesque, it seems he was made by the guys who worked on monsters, so he's pretty great. Laura looks like an overly eager potato, though. I won't say these character meshes are bad, they are perfectly serviceable, but the original and later SH3 were benchmarks of character modeling back at their time. SH2 original models did not stay as fresh as those in SH3, though.

Finally, overall playtime seems to be around 16 to 20 hours for an average playthrough, while the original was roughly half as long, and I'd say the remake would actually be better from cutting something like a quarter of it, probably creating some optional areas to inspect if you want, like police station in SH1. Game does drag a bit. I personally wasn't affected by it much, as usually all areas did pay off. But to each his own.

The game presented the thick, overwhelming atmosphere, slowly dawning on you to later give a slight release and roll back in full yet again. Foggy, dark, rusted, grated, fleshy and concrete, quiet and abandoned, the voyage is very true to the spirit of classic Silent Hill.

As for performance - I was among the lucky unaffected by stutters or crashes. No, I'm lying - it did crash once for me, and I also got stuck on level geometry once. That's the main technical issues I've got.

I can say that this is a good remake, made by people who knew what they were doing and actually did care about the original. However it is deeply flawed and has some fundamental problems. But the good points clearly far outweigh the negatives, Though the global asking price of $70 is clearly far too high.

the quests become boring very fast, if you finished the first act you will fly over the others faster and faster until you encounter the point where you could NEED some other player to go with you. well...if nobody of your real life friends play this game you can forget it. in the community you wont find SOCIAL or FRIENDLY people. only egoistic and rude ones.

Path of Exile,238960,30022340,"[b]TL;DR[/b]
This is a great game. Try it out, its free anyway.

[h1]Review:[/h1]
Path of Exile is a ftp-Action_RPG game, released 2013 and being under continued development since then, having had multiple free expansions, leagues and content updates. It can be played solo or in a party with up to 5 other people on either soft- or hardcore.

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Free to Play, only cosmetical purchases
-dark & gritty style fitting the story and lore
-insanely deep and varied skill system
-smooth leveling experience
-expansive and challenging endgame
-interesting and unique currency and crafting system
-free trading economy
-seasonal leagues with their own twists and challenges to keep the game fresh
-regular free content patches
-big and friendly community
-around 5h of soundtrack
-nice looking cosmetical microtransactions

[b]Cons:[/b]
-this will eat your time
-start of play can be unimpressive
-since this is a always online game, connection issues can be a problem
-daunting skill tree
-through the leveling process you have to play the same story 3 times in increasing difficulty (changed in the future*)

*as of now, the new expansion ""Fall of Oriath"" has been announced for mid 2017, adding 6 new acts to the 4 existing ones, therefore eliminating the need to replay the story 3 times. (i have a boner)

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
For anyone interested in the action-rpg genre and disappointed by Diablo 3, look no further than this ftp-gem called Path of Exile. Challenging, rewarding and smooth to play, this appeals to everyone: the casual softcore to the min-maxing hardcore player. There is little as rewarding as building up your own character, theorycrafting, gearing, fighting, struggling and finally concquering everything the game has to offer. And then doing another one, thats complety different. And another one.
For someone new to the action-rpg genre, don't get scared by the seemingly endless possibilites and mechanics the game offers you, punch through the somewhat tedious first 2-3 hours of the game and enter the realm of the game that will suck you in and never let you out again.

Huge passive tree, lots of active skills (gems), different ways of attack and defend, buffs and debuffs, type of weapons and magic, six classes each with 3 sub top classes and one class which is mix of all of them, and links and synergies between all this stuff. It all leads to literally endless variations how you can build your character and play it.

Path of Exile,238960,30113475,"[h1]I don't have a lot of Hours on this, as I just started playing it through steam. I have been playing Path of Exile since June of 2012 http://i.imgur.com/jeP6URF.png and have thousands of hours on it.[/h1]

It is among the most amazingly awesome games I have ever played. Coming from Diablo 2: LoD, and the various mods (Valhalla, Eastern Sun, Median, etc) this game is perfect for me. 

* I will start here, with the things that I enjoy about it.

1. Diversity among builds. Want to shoot a thousand exploding arrows per second (Quill Rain + Chain/Greater Multiple Projectiles/Exploding Arrow/Fire Penetration)? Want to blast rays of fire that launch exploding balls of magma (Scorching Ray/Cast While Channeling/ Fire Penetration/ Multiple Projectiles/Magma Orb)? Want to call forth the fury of the heavens with a mighty scepter, smashing your foes into submission (Mjolnir+ Lightning Strike/Arc/StormCall/Spark/Multistrike)? The sheer amount of ways you can go about destroying mobs is limited only to your imagination. 

2. Story is great, very interestnig, and keeps you entertaining while playing through the game. Unlike other ARPGS of similar play style, Path of Exile is able to effectively deliver a quality story along with the extremely well done gameplay.

3. Scenery is dark and grim, gloomy, morbid, and full of gore. From corpse ridden beaches, ancient temples filled with undead and skeletons, destitute crumbling cities, palace cellars flooded with blood - ridden with heaps of corpses and twisted miscreations, echocing crystal caverns of golems and mutated freaks. The variety in enemies and terrain is very broad. 

4. Item creation, map alteration and creation, uber dungeons. There is plenty of challenge to be had in this game, thus keeping you striving to achieve ever greater power and push yourself ot the absolute limits of your capabilities.

5. Infinite replayablity. I have made probably 50+ characters so far, and each one gets progressively more powerful as I understand more about the game, the mechanics, and how to build them effectively. 

6. Temp Leagues + Ladder. Nuff said.

7. Constant expansion and content updates. The game is constantly being updated, minor balance tweaks, additional items, skills, monsters, maps, etc. It's amazing.

8. Grinding Gear Games are among the most amazing gaming company. Really really good people and they constantly interact and have dialogue with the playerbase. ""How do you guys feel about X? Does Y feel right to you? If you could change X, what would you do and why?"" etc.

[b]I could go on for another thousand lines but I feel as though I got the point across. The game is amazingly fun and addicting.[/b]

[h1]Now, for the things that, I don't necessarily ""dislike"" - but things that I feel may dissuade other people from playing the game.[/h1]

1. Learning Curve is incredibly steep. Your first 3-5 characters will be absolute trash. You need to do a bit of research on what to do and how to build effectively, otherwise you're probably going to get wrecked hard once you get to a4 merciless. Here is a beginners guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEZtq6FSebE&list=PLjlRwdIo6SixoG_Bo5bhKCzZtOMVuVnJZ&index=8&t=8s

2. Repetition of acts, 3 difficulties (however, this will be gone come July - TEN ACTS ONE PLAYTHROUGH HYPE!) Going from Normal, to Cruel, and then to Merciless can really put people off. Myself, I'm used to it and have done it since d2 so it's just a normal thing for the arpg genre. GGG are going to change that though.

3. Item crafting is [b]extremely[/b] expensive. Like, unfathomably expensive. I have never crafted an item before other than throwing an alch and a couple chaos into a rare item. 

4. Currency is nightmarishly rare. I've found maybe 4 exalted orbs in my entire time playing this game. Two of them were just within the last week as well. I have only ever owned two 6-link items. Wings of Entropy, and some random rare 2h sword that is garbage. 

5. poe.trade is the only real way to trade. $Chat is a scam 100% of the time. Once they implement a real trading system other than posting shops online and checking the forums every 3 minutes, or browsing poe.trade for an hour at a time trying to find an item to fill a hole in your build this game will be just shy of perfection.

Those are really the only negative things I can think of that might dissuade a player from sticking around... the game is magnificent.

I highly, highly suggest you play.

Path of Exile,238960,29758291,"Random Lazy Review (SP):

This game may be inspired heavily by diablo 2 but presented a pinnacle of greatness out of itself.

+ One handed easy to play isometric hack and slash worldwide standard.
+ Main storyline, missions are decent enough.
+ Every single game mechanic is perfected to the extremes.
+ Huge skill tree, interesting gem properties resulting in brilliant active skills.
+ Artistic/Graphical side and variety of characters, enemies, landscapes etc. are a sight for sore eyes


Some of minor issues ""for me"" which has no effect on the value fo the game:
- Where is the pause button? Respawning of monsters in a particular map whenever you are disconnected or hit esc to get a coffee. You have to go through everytime.
- Too much unecessary loot (little bugs droping heavy armours!).
- Countless of weapons which make no sense. (a common problem with diablo genre)

 Bottomline : Evil Blizzard's worst nightmare.

Recommend : Play it now.

This game has incredible depth and unique varied RPG systems that makes leveling up really fun. You have the skill tree (similar to FFX) as you level. You also have skill gems and gem slots that allow you to add, remove, and mod skills with other skills. Its a very fun system. You can also level up those skills too.

Destiny 2,1085660,178167282,"Destiny 2 feels amazing to play, the gun-play is top notch, the build crafting is also pretty amazing. I find myself spending many hours outside the game researching builds and weapon combos. A lot of the game's activities are accessible very early into your journey, including the most recent expansion, the final shape, which is well written, very challenging and well worth the investment. 

The main downside to the game (personal opinion) is that its designed to appeal to players who want to log in daily, and a lot of the really fun and challenging activities are tied behind long, arduous grinds. Becoming high enough light level (in game recognition of your time spent) to do the best activities is ok, within reason. Destiny has an RNG based approach to gaining higher powered gear, and it can often mean spending a lot of time to earn gear which will drop in a slot you already have at that level.

I will often say to my friends this is one of the best feeling and looking games, weighed down by some design choices that really hurt new and more casual players.

From my personal experience, Destiny is an amazing game, until you get bogged down in the roots of it. Play it casually and you will come back fresh each time, enjoy your experience and be able to move on when needed. Take it too seriously and chances are you will be frustrated.",destiny  feels amazing to play the gunplay is top notch the build crafting is also pretty amazing i find myself spending many hours outside the game researching builds and weapon combos a lot of the games activities are accessible very early into your journey including the most recent expansion the final shape which is well written very challenging and well worth the investment the main downside to the game personal opinion is that its designed to appeal to players who want to log in daily and a lot of the really fun and challenging activities are tied behind long arduous grinds becoming high enough light level in game recognition of your time spent to do the best activities is ok within reason destiny has an rng based approach to gaining higher powered gear and it can often mean spending a lot of time to earn gear which will drop in a slot you already have at that level i will often say to my friends this is one of the best feeling and looking games weighed down by some design choices that really hurt new and more casual players from my personal experience destiny is an amazing game until you get bogged down in the roots of it play it casually and you will come back fresh each time enjoy your experience and be able to move on when needed take it too seriously and chances are you will be frustrated,POS,['AA'],AA
Destiny 2,1085660,177556931,"I've been playing Destiny going on Ten Years now.   I've been around since the beginning of D1 through the horrible DLCS, around for the better ones (Oryx <3).  After that I was ready to pickup D2 as soon as it released. Yes, it has been long and winding and arduous with all of the changes, and content and nerfs and buffs and balancing and it really never ends. This game isn't just a game to grind though. I've made and lost countless friends, raided with people from around the world, saw the culmination of TEN YEARS of story with my best friend who I still play with to this day. Yes, you can play the numbers and make yourself the most efficient killing machine, but you can also have those moments that only games like Halo had brought previously.  Hilarious deaths that should never have happened because you got WAAAYYY to carried away with a heavy grenade launcher.  Rage moments because today isn't your day for PVP but your fire team is just happy you can get on to play.  I've killed gods and seen warlords fall, I have traveled through countless iterations of reality in search of a fabled hero who's name was only mentioned in the fables of old.  We felled the TAKEN KING, the EMPEROR OF THE CABAL EMPIRE, and the Vex keeper of TIME ITSELF and battled our way out of the clutches of THE WITCH QUEEN.  I have yet to fell THE WITNESS, but it's definitely on my list.  If you want an experience of forging your own story, Destiny 2 is the right game.  Even if it shut down tomorrow, the experiences that I've had exploring this shared universe will be something I will be able to talk about well after it's gone with the people that shared the journey along the way.

Destiny 2,1085660,177303540,"TL;DR
I don't recommend this game unless you are willing to walk on broken glass for a hundred hours before getting to the good part. If you get past that there is plenty of content to enjoy(hoping they don't delete years of it) and a great core gameplay loop. Having faith that Bungie will improve on this game is a gamble so if you expect anything from them you will likely be disappointed.

Although Destiny is the best looter shooter to ever exist, I cannot recommend it someone unless I know they are willing to put up with a ton of slop. I'll start with the positives. Destiny has some of the best gunplay in the industry combined with a very fun to use ability system. The lore of the game is also great if you are able to separate it from the story that is portrayed in the game itself. I can't understate how strong the core gameplay loop is but almost everything else sucks. The game is very expensive to get into. Bungie expects new players to drop a ton of money in order to get into the game even though it is advertised as free to play. In reality there is a free demo that contains minimal amounts of content and the content that is present is often overlooked by Bungie because they can't profit off of it. If you are willing to drop a hundred dollars or more to get into the game then you will be greeted by one of the worst new player experiences ever crafted. You will either be forced to sit through cutscenes and loaded into missions unexpectedly or be given zero guidance on how to engage with the game and be forced to rely on youtubers or friends to guide you. The quality of expansions and seasonal content is shaky at best so if you end up preordering you will be disappointed half the time. As Bungie had been ramping up the cost of the game over the past few years players hoped that these funds would be reinvested into the game or perhaps a Destiny 3. As it turns out, they put all this money into other projects that spectacularly failed sending hundreds of millions of Destiny's money down the drain. If you can overlook all of these flaws and many more then maybe consider trying out the game.",tldr i dont recommend this game unless you are willing to walk on broken glass for a hundred hours before getting to the good part if you get past that there is plenty of content to enjoyhoping they dont delete years of it and a great core gameplay loop having faith that bungie will improve on this game is a gamble so if you expect anything from them you will likely be disappointed although destiny is the best looter shooter to ever exist i cannot recommend it someone unless i know they are willing to put up with a ton of slop ill start with the positives destiny has some of the best gunplay in the industry combined with a very fun to use ability system the lore of the game is also great if you are able to separate it from the story that is portrayed in the game itself i cant understate how strong the core gameplay loop is but almost everything else sucks the game is very expensive to get into bungie expects new players to drop a ton of money in order to get into the game even though it is advertised as free to play in reality there is a free demo that contains minimal amounts of content and the content that is present is often overlooked by bungie because they cant profit off of it if you are willing to drop a hundred dollars or more to get into the game then you will be greeted by one of the worst new player experiences ever crafted you will either be forced to sit through cutscenes and loaded into missions unexpectedly or be given zero guidance on how to engage with the game and be forced to rely on youtubers or friends to guide you the quality of expansions and seasonal content is shaky at best so if you end up preordering you will be disappointed half the time as bungie had been ramping up the cost of the game over the past few years players hoped that these funds would be reinvested into the game or perhaps a destiny  as it turns out they put all this money into other projects that spectacularly failed sending hundreds of millions of destinys money down the drain if you can overlook all of these flaws and many more then maybe consider trying out the game,NEU,['AA'],AA

Black Desert,582660,178285753,"An interesting if quickly repetitive canned-animation-combat system build on the grindiest afk-to-progress pseudo-MMO around.

It looks amazing with settings ramped up but optimisation has remained an issue since launch.
The world is huge and believable but you only end up going to specific locations to farm and place alts on the various other locations of note (world-boss-spawns, key interactables, seasonal event locations).
There's in theory ""forces PvP flagging"" after you hit ""midgame"" (you can't unlock your bonus weapon without allowing/opting yourself to PvP flag in certain areas/environments from that point on with that character but the PvP is entirely about hard-counters, level discrepancies and gear-score so if someone decides to engage you to kick you off a farm-spot you will simply die without presenting the merest hint of a challenge. 

Core gameplay is grinding the 1-2 spots optimal for massed trash-drops (vendored for money), xp and certain quest/artifact/crafting/enhancement drops.
Gear progression is 1-15+5 armour/weapon levels that can downgrade/break when you inevitably fail (there's P2W and in-game purchasable items to prevent the downgrade), jewelry goes to +5 but it is simply destroyed on failure. Upgrades fundamentally are about ""stacking failures"" to upgrade cheap items so you can apply that bonus/multiplier to the item you actually want to improve, it's exactly as obnoxious as it sounds and even the introduction of a pity-system for failed upgrades isn't quite enough given the general aquisition rate of upgrade mats for anyone who doesn't live in the game or play the market 24/7 (not that there's much to sell anymore, the market's flush with years worth of accumulated tradeskilling/farming thou sales only last 30 days iirc) the most profitable item at this point seems to be wood and stone, 2 items that can't be afk-farmed.

The story tries but it's hours of stilted dialogue sometimes 5-10 minutes of exposition between hand-ins. 

Ultimately it's a game that utterly fails to respect your time despite having a whole heap of fairly interesting sounding features and a remarkably wide array of classes.

Black Desert,582660,177546456,"With hundreds of hours of gameplay invested in this MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online), I can say that “Black Desert” offers a unique and immersive experience, but not without challenges and controversies.

Strengths

1. Graphics and Art Design:
One of the most obvious strengths of “Black Desert” is its exceptional graphics. The graphics engine was developed by Pearl Abyss and allows for incredible detail of the environment, characters, and animations. The landscapes are stunning, from sunny beaches and dense forests to elaborate cities, with every detail contributing to the creation of an immersive world. The character customization features are among the most advanced in the industry, giving players the ability to create unique characters with fine detail.

2. Dynamic Combat System:
The combat system in “Black Desert” is one of the most captivating aspects of the game. Unlike many traditional MMOs that use a tab-based system, BDO adopts a real-time combat system, allowing players to execute combinations of attacks, abilities, and escapes. This approach gives the game tactical depth, requires a certain degree of dexterity, and makes confrontations more interesting. Each class has a distinct fighting style, and the ability to switch between available classes adds a nice variety.

3. Activities and Economy:
“Black Desert” is not just a fighting game; it offers a wide range of extracurricular activities. From fishing and farming to trading and crafting, the game allows players to engage in various economic activities. The economy system is complex and interconnected, and players can take advantage of trade opportunities to build their wealth. Crafting activities, in particular, are well-developed, and obtaining the materials needed to create rare items can be an exciting challenge.

4. Community and Events:
The community in “Black Desert” is diverse and active, with numerous guilds and groups organizing events. The game also benefits from seasonal events and frequent updates, which bring new content and challenges. This interaction with other players contributes to a sense of belonging and brings an important social dimension to the game.

Weaknesses

1. Steep Learning Curve:
One of the main drawbacks of “Black Desert” is its steep learning curve. At first, the game can seem overwhelming due to the complex systems and multiple options available. The combat mechanics, economy, and character progression take time to master, and new players may feel lost without proper guidance.

2. Grinding Issues:
While there is a variety of activities available, some players may find the excessive grinding required for progression frustrating. Increasing experience levels, obtaining rare equipment, and developing skills require significant playtime. This can make the game feel repetitive in the long run, especially for those who don’t enjoy the side activities.

3. Microtransactions:
Another controversial aspect is the implementation of microtransactions. While the game is free to play, there are payment options for various items and perks, which can create a “pay-to-win” feeling for some players. This has drawn criticism from the community, especially for those who don’t want to invest additional money in the game.

Conclusion
“Black Desert Online” is a game that brings together spectacular graphics, a dynamic combat system, and a wide range of activities. However, the steep learning curve and potential grind may discourage some players. With an active community and regular events, BDO offers a robust and engaging MMO experience, but it requires time and effort to be fully appreciated.",with hundreds of hours of gameplay invested in this mmo massively multiplayer online i can say that black desert offers a unique and immersive experience but not without challenges and controversies strengths  graphics and art design one of the most obvious strengths of black desert is its exceptional graphics the graphics engine was developed by pearl abyss and allows for incredible detail of the environment characters and animations the landscapes are stunning from sunny beaches and dense forests to elaborate cities with every detail contributing to the creation of an immersive world the character customization features are among the most advanced in the industry giving players the ability to create unique characters with fine detail  dynamic combat system the combat system in black desert is one of the most captivating aspects of the game unlike many traditional mmos that use a tabbased system bdo adopts a realtime combat system allowing players to execute combinations of attacks abilities and escapes this approach gives the game tactical depth requires a certain degree of dexterity and makes confrontations more interesting each class has a distinct fighting style and the ability to switch between available classes adds a nice variety  activities and economy black desert is not just a fighting game it offers a wide range of extracurricular activities from fishing and farming to trading and crafting the game allows players to engage in various economic activities the economy system is complex and interconnected and players can take advantage of trade opportunities to build their wealth crafting activities in particular are welldeveloped and obtaining the materials needed to create rare items can be an exciting challenge  community and events the community in black desert is diverse and active with numerous guilds and groups organizing events the game also benefits from seasonal events and frequent updates which bring new content and challenges this interaction with other players contributes to a sense of belonging and brings an important social dimension to the game weaknesses  steep learning curve one of the main drawbacks of black desert is its steep learning curve at first the game can seem overwhelming due to the complex systems and multiple options available the combat mechanics economy and character progression take time to master and new players may feel lost without proper guidance  grinding issues while there is a variety of activities available some players may find the excessive grinding required for progression frustrating increasing experience levels obtaining rare equipment and developing skills require significant playtime this can make the game feel repetitive in the long run especially for those who dont enjoy the side activities  microtransactions another controversial aspect is the implementation of microtransactions while the game is free to play there are payment options for various items and perks which can create a paytowin feeling for some players this has drawn criticism from the community especially for those who dont want to invest additional money in the game conclusion black desert online is a game that brings together spectacular graphics a dynamic combat system and a wide range of activities however the steep learning curve and potential grind may discourage some players with an active community and regular events bdo offers a robust and engaging mmo experience but it requires time and effort to be fully appreciated,POS,['Indie'],Indie

Black Desert,582660,178117382,"[h1] An MMO That Sets the Bar [/h1]

[i] As a long-time MMO fan, I had Black Desert on my radar even before its release, and it has more than delivered. With over 1000 hours of playtime, I can confidently say it's one of the best MMOs out there. [/i]

[hr][/hr]

[h2] Combat That Stands Out [/h2]

[b]Hands down, the best combat system in the genre.[/b] The action-combat style is fluid, intense, and extremely satisfying. Every class feels unique, and mastering combos really makes a difference. Unlike the traditional tab-targeting system found in many MMOs, Black Desert’s combat is skill-based and adds a huge layer of excitement to every fight.

[hr][/hr]

[h2] RNG - Love It or Hate It [/h2]

[u]I personally love the RNG in Black Desert[/u]. Yes, it's brutal and can be punishing, but that’s also what makes it so rewarding when you finally succeed. You’re always on the edge, hoping for that big moment, and that anticipation keeps me coming back. [spoiler]For some, the RNG might be too frustrating, but I think it adds a unique thrill that’s missing in other MMOs.[/spoiler]

[hr][/hr]

[h2] P2W? Not Really. [/h2]

This is one of the most debated points about Black Desert. For me, it's [u]not pay-to-win[/u]. Sure, spending money can speed things up, but even with a big wallet, the RNG aspect means there's no guaranteed advantage. To actually have a significant edge, you’d need to spend ridiculous amounts of cash—far more than most players would ever consider. [b]It’s all about commitment and patience here.[/b]

[hr][/hr]

[h2] AFK Progress - For Busy Gamers [/h2]

Black Desert offers a lot of semi-AFK or fully AFK progression options, which is a huge plus. From fishing to trading and more, you can still make meaningful progress when you're away from the screen. It’s one of the few games where I feel productive even when I’m logged out, which is perfect for someone with a busy schedule.

If you're into MMOs, Black Desert is worth every minute. It's challenging, rewarding, and always keeps you on your toes. The grind is real, but so are the rewards. Highly recommended!

DayZ,221100,177857539,"It genuinely pains me to NOT recommend this game to new players as obviously I have spent a lot of time playing this game and probably will continue to. I love this game, but cannot recommend to a new player because half of the time I hate it just as much, and I don't really think the reward is worth the suffering you have to endure to have an actual enjoyable experience on it. I'll summarize my thoughts on this game in 3 main points, one good, one bad, and one neutral.

1: Time (Neutral)
DayZ is not a game to play after work or school or if you have any obligation that day whatsoever. When you play this game, get ready to dedicate 2 hours just to finding a good server and meeting up with your friends so you can actually start doing something 'fun'. That's if you're lucky and don't die in the process. Sure, you can play a modded server with infinite sprint. a group system and a map, but then everybody on the server groups up in huge clans, and run in packs from each military base. It ruins the fundamentals of the game which are built on exploration, curiosity, and desperation. DayZ is all about the journey, and the friends you make along the way. If you're playing this game to run around and shoot people, you can do that. It would probably just be more fun on Tarkov or Warzone. There is NO instant gratification in this game. Everything you have to earn, and everything WILL be lost eventually. This game will constantly leave you feeling like you just haven't had enough, either by being so fun and exciting that you don't ever want to play any other game again, or by being so broken and unfulfilling that it sucks you in looking for that excitement it once gave you, only to chew you up and spit you out at the end wondering where the previous 12 hours went.

2: Fear adrenaline, trauma, and bonding (Good)
DayZ has always done one thing right, and for awhile, it was the only non horror game capable of evoking this genuine fear, and in some respects, it still is. It's not just fear in the sense that you don't want the scary monster to appear on the screen, it's an actual fear of loss. The more time you spend alive, the more you feel like you should be dead, and it's almost a breath of fresh air to respawn on the coast because you don't have to carry the burden of your gear on your shoulders anymore. You are always a target to other players, and you become so scared, other players are always a target to you. Sometimes, and I mean sometimes, someone will miss a shot or run out of ammo or get knocked unconscious instead of dying, and in those instances, you have a chance to use your voice chat and make a friend! Just remember, at the end of the day, everyone wants their life to last longer than yours. Trust nobody, until you do. This would be a stronger point and would be THE ONLY GOOD REASON to buy and play DayZ if you haven't already, but, It's just not a good enough reason by todays' standards in gaming. With so many popular survival, battle royale and extraction shooters out nowadays, such as Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, Rust, Project Zomboid, Stalker, Etc. There is sadly, becoming less of a need for DayZ, with newer, more polished games coming out that evoke the same feeling that Dayz does. Not to mention the Arma: Reforger DayZ mod which I believe has lots of potential to be a better Dayz experience than the standalone game if given some time. This leads me to my next point;

3: Performance (bad)
This game runs like shit, and it's aging poorly. I have a 4070, 12600k, 32gb of DDR4 4000, and an SSD and this game still has constant hitches, stutters, freezes, and crashes after YEARS of support and updates. It's genuinely unacceptable how badly optimized this game is, and how little effort the devs put in to making it more stable. There have been false promises for stability patches for YEARS, but I given up hope on ever being able to run the game smoothly. I have done months worth of research to pinpoint the reason, I've upgraded my PC, tried a completely different PC, new monitors, adjusted my mouse polling rate, tinkered with the cfg file and shortened my render distance, etc. etc. etc. Nothing works. For awhile, I had convinced myself that there was some setting I was missing, that if I just put in a little more time optimizing my PC or if I bought a newer, better part the game would finally run well. I am here to warn any potential new player once and for all; this game runs like HOT GARBAGE and it always will. Expect to lose progress to glitches and crashes that aren't your fault, expect your time to feel wasted. It's going to happen.

In summary, I can't recommend DayZ to a new player because personally, I just have not gotten back what I've put into this game, and it's very disappointing. I RELUCTANTLY DO NOT RECOMMEND DAYZ, but do recommend Escape from Tarkov or the DayZ Arma mod if you want the same experience. DayZ started something great, it's just not that great anymore. :(",it genuinely pains me to not recommend this game to new players as obviously i have spent a lot of time playing this game and probably will continue to i love this game but cannot recommend to a new player because half of the time i hate it just as much and i dont really think the reward is worth the suffering you have to endure to have an actual enjoyable experience on it ill summarize my thoughts on this game in  main points one good one bad and one neutral  time neutral dayz is not a game to play after work or school or if you have any obligation that day whatsoever when you play this game get ready to dedicate  hours just to finding a good server and meeting up with your friends so you can actually start doing something fun thats if youre lucky and dont die in the process sure you can play a modded server with infinite sprint a group system and a map but then everybody on the server groups up in huge clans and run in packs from each military base it ruins the fundamentals of the game which are built on exploration curiosity and desperation dayz is all about the journey and the friends you make along the way if youre playing this game to run around and shoot people you can do that it would probably just be more fun on tarkov or warzone there is no instant gratification in this game everything you have to earn and everything will be lost eventually this game will constantly leave you feeling like you just havent had enough either by being so fun and exciting that you dont ever want to play any other game again or by being so broken and unfulfilling that it sucks you in looking for that excitement it once gave you only to chew you up and spit you out at the end wondering where the previous  hours went  fear adrenaline trauma and bonding good dayz has always done one thing right and for awhile it was the only non horror game capable of evoking this genuine fear and in some respects it still is its not just fear in the sense that you dont want the scary monster to appear on the screen its an actual fear of loss the more time you spend alive the more you feel like you should be dead and its almost a breath of fresh air to respawn on the coast because you dont have to carry the burden of your gear on your shoulders anymore you are always a target to other players and you become so scared other players are always a target to you sometimes and i mean sometimes someone will miss a shot or run out of ammo or get knocked unconscious instead of dying and in those instances you have a chance to use your voice chat and make a friend just remember at the end of the day everyone wants their life to last longer than yours trust nobody until you do this would be a stronger point and would be the only good reason to buy and play dayz if you havent already but its just not a good enough reason by todays standards in gaming with so many popular survival battle royale and extraction shooters out nowadays such as escape from tarkov hunt showdown rust project zomboid stalker etc there is sadly becoming less of a need for dayz with newer more polished games coming out that evoke the same feeling that dayz does not to mention the arma reforger dayz mod which i believe has lots of potential to be a better dayz experience than the standalone game if given some time this leads me to my next point  performance bad this game runs like shit and its aging poorly i have a  k gb of ddr  and an ssd and this game still has constant hitches stutters freezes and crashes after years of support and updates its genuinely unacceptable how badly optimized this game is and how little effort the devs put in to making it more stable there have been false promises for stability patches for years but i given up hope on ever being able to run the game smoothly i have done months worth of research to pinpoint the reason ive upgraded my pc tried a completely different pc new monitors adjusted my mouse polling rate tinkered with the cfg file and shortened my render distance etc etc etc nothing works for awhile i had convinced myself that there was some setting i was missing that if i just put in a little more time optimizing my pc or if i bought a newer better part the game would finally run well i am here to warn any potential new player once and for all this game runs like hot garbage and it always will expect to lose progress to glitches and crashes that arent your fault expect your time to feel wasted its going to happen in summary i cant recommend dayz to a new player because personally i just have not gotten back what ive put into this game and its very disappointing i reluctantly do not recommend dayz but do recommend escape from tarkov or the dayz arma mod if you want the same experience dayz started something great its just not that great anymore ,NEG,"['Unknown', 'AA']",Multiple

Halo Infinite,1240440,177672245,"TLDR; game's fun, I'd play campaign again especially with friends. Multiplayer has genuine issues that people seem to either vehemently hate or completely ignore or even defend. This game is a testament to corporations' fetishes for infinite (heh) growth infesting and profiteering on something as simple as games.

===========================

Oof first Halo game I actually didn't like. Don't get me wrong, the campaign is fun and the forge tools are bonkers, but 343 really pulled out the thesis in ""how to kill a multiplayer fanbase"" on this one and pulled it out fast. A live-service game (supposedly) where they add maps every few months (usually made by the community), add new game types every year, and add.... 1 weapon over the course of the game's lifecycle.

The multiplayer is fun at first, but damn if the SBMM sucks. SBMM gets a bad rap because people at the top of the leaderboards complain and lackeys parrot the message, but in this game it truly does suck. You do well one match only to get paired with a braindead team as ""the best player"" on your side and are matched against a party that pubstomps. Get one match 30-and-0 only to go 2-and-10 the next feels just old and tired after a while. I can't even play with friends because we'll get matched with people on my level and they go zilch the whole game.

And for real, can we put the KBM/controller conversation to bed? It took 343 over a year to fix the KBM support, and yet surprise surprise, a game that incentivizes keeping crosshairs on an enemy due to longer TTK would be easier on a controller with aim assist. Is it as night-and-day as everyone says? No, not at all. But anyone who tries to say it doesn't exist is either baiting or hasn't actually tried both methods. Some weapons just feel absolutely terrible on KBM (looking at you, stalker rifle). What's worse is the main tactic to avoid gunfire is quick-strafing, which does nothing for controller players and is significantly harder to deal with on KBM. It's worse than other Halos because, for some reason, 343 turned up the acceleration to high heaven. 343 just never had to deal with this before because they only made console games and had 3rd parties port everything for them. No wonder why Master Chief Collection feels so much better, they outsourced it to competent devs.

And all the dick-riding justifying the microtransactions is tiresome, honestly. Are people not realizing it's 20-fucking-dollars for a single skin? Can people not realize the campaign costs $60? They're not really 'micro' when a single set can cost 1/3 the price of the full game. Heck, some are half the price! LASO, let alone Legendary, didn't even give you any reward! Nothing. All you got was ""red and green"" skins for finding boxes in the campaign. People are really rationalizing ""they have to make money to keep the lights on"" when deadass they have peanuts to show for it in terms of reinvesting into the live-service model. Passes that you can buy for playing the previous? Gone. Now we get a bunch of credits and 1 armor set every couple of weeks with obviously cooler ones in the cash shop. Goodbye weekly ultimate rewards, hello 1K good boy points.

The one positive I will say is that you can still at least earn enough in the passes that still exist to buy all the older ones. That's a genuinely appreciated system that was very fresh and pro-consumer for its time and popular enough that other companies started to adopt it as well.

I would bandwagon and say ""give Halo back to Bungie!"" but Jesus, do people not realize they're just as bad?

Red Dead Redemption 2,1174180,178708752,"This review reflects my personal feelings as a player who hasn’t played the first Red Dead Redemption game and didn’t have any expectations going in. The game is quite long in terms of story, taking me around 75 hours to complete, but I don’t regret a single hour spent. This game is absolutely worth it. Here are my thoughts on the main aspects of the game:

1. STORY
The story in Red Dead Redemption 2 is long, gripping, and full of twists, taking me about 75 hours to complete. Each chapter brings something new, keeping the experience fresh and engaging. The plot introduces us to a wide range of characters, each with their own personalities and backgrounds, which gives the story depth but also requires careful attention. There are so many characters to keep track of that it’s essential to pay attention to their roles, as some names can easily start to blend together. Watching Arthur Morgan, the main protagonist, navigate complex relationships and situations was one of the best parts of the story. This journey is full of emotional moments, unexpected turns, and intense scenes that kept me hooked from beginning to end.

2. GAMEPLAY
The gameplay is incredibly smooth, with a wide selection of weapons to choose from, ranging from revolvers and rifles to bows. The controls feel responsive, and exploring the vast open world is satisfying and immersive. There’s a realistic sense of variety in what you can do—from hunting animals to discovering random camps and visiting bustling towns. The world feels alive with details, like diverse animals to hunt, items to sell, and dynamic weather and landscapes.
One good feature is the crafting system, where you can create your own specialized ammunition, like fire arrows and explosive bullets, as well as health items to aid you in survival. This adds another layer of customization to how you approach different situations and fights. One small downside, however, is the horseback riding, which can be a bit clunky. Sometimes the horse changes direction unexpectedly or trips over small objects instead of leaping over them. Despite this, the gameplay is highly enjoyable and full of options that make every hour in the game worthwhile.

3. GRAPHICS
I have never played a game that is so graphically and visually detailed. Even though the game has been out for a few years, it still looks better than many newer games. I often spent hours just walking through forests, watching or hunting animals, and admiring the beautiful scenery. The environments, weather effects, and character animations are breathtakingly realistic, making the game feel immersive.

4. ACHIEVEMENTS
I love collecting achievements in games, and because Red Dead Redemption 2 is such an excellent game, I aimed to get as many achievements as possible. With so many types of animals, it took me dozens of hours to track, study, and skin them all to earn certain achievements. Even though these achievements took a long time to complete, I enjoyed every moment. However, there are a few achievements that are simply grindy rather than challenging or fun. For example, the story mode has an achievement that requires you to kill and skin 16 bears, which becomes more of a tedious task. The online achievements have similar issues, like needing to own five horses, which costs around $2,500 in-game currency. Given that missions only reward around $20 each, this achievement can be frustratingly grindy.

5. ONLINE MODE
The online mode is disappointing, which isn’t surprising considering Rockstar’s history with online games. Missions are repetitive, and high-level players often target new, low-level players, making the experience frustrating. Additionally, the servers are unstable, and the game crashes frequently. In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is a failed addition to an otherwise amazing game.

FINAL THOUGHTS
In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Red Dead Redemption 2. The story, gameplay, graphics, and achievements (despite a few frustrations) make it an outstanding game. Though the online mode was disappointing, the single-player experience alone is well worth it.

Maybe you invite a buddy to your world to see into one's logical mind.
You can witness your friend evolve from a novice installer to a master architect too, which is fascinating.

It transforms the way you look at systems, whether in the game or in life. and alter how you approach problems, not just in the game, but in real life too.

Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178034815,"Steam Deck Review:
Gotta love the gameplay of being kicked out of the game and getting a black screen because you're not connected to the internet. If you're planning to buy this with the intention of playing it offline and on the go then I would heavily disregard this game. This game kicks you out of a 50$ game YOU the consumer bought because you don't have internet for a SINGLEPLAYER game. I was super excited to play this last night and downloaded it when I had wifi, only to be met with a screen saying I need to be signed into rockstar games to play it. Loved the game back then but this one right here is one of the reason why we need physical copies still, pay for a game and you can't even play it without signing MULTIPLE terms of agreements.

Edited review: Review up top was a first hands impression of using the rockstar launcher. I will say after signing into an account and being online for a day you can use it offline for the foreseeable future. However being new to the having to sign in into an online launcher for an offline game that I could've done no problem back in 2010 when the game released is still stupid.
Gameplay: I find that the game runs really great on the steam deck compared to most steam games I find ""playable"" on there. If I hadn't run into any issue initially I'd say this would be a perfect fit for the steam deck seeing as I get no frame drops while playing the game for long periods of hours.

What you receive for $50 USD is a port of a game that released 14 years ago and it's DLC expansion.

You still get muddy textures, weird audio, NPCs getting stuck on terrain during story missions, etc.

On the performance end, everything seems fine. I'm using a 3060 so I'd expect it to run well, which it did. The Steam Deck seemed to struggle with some higher settings, even with FSR on Ultra Performance.

New World: Aeternum,1063730,177079477,"You should play New world and here is why:

Weapons and abilities - rarely do you find an mmo with classless combat done right, there truely is no right or wrong build here. Sure, will you deal less damage if you choose the “wrong” weapons and ability combinations? Yes, do you like how playing with them feels? Then do it because the game gives you that freedom.

Story - traditionally most players skip through dialogue in games like this to progress faster, nothing wrong with that and I am very much one of those people, but now that every main quest is voice acted and sets the scene for a world that is constantly changing and evolving as you progress on the adventure. Your journey and why you are fighting the monsters and creatures ties in very well without being too cheesy or forced.

Player vs environment - the combat feels punchy, you feel very powerful throught most of the game while still maintaining a sense of struggle to get to the top. Progression feels meaningful and planning ahead of your next fight will benefit you greatly. I have high hopes for future pvm encounters because the developers have left so much room to expand on current and future mechanics alike.

Player vs player - whether you want short, straight forward fighting, strategic push and pull objective based fights, or chaotic open world free for all duels and open world pvp, it’s there. Nothing to lose and everything to gain, the game encourages you to home your skills which will benefit your teammates and give a sense of gradification when you outplay your opponents.

Crafting and economy - certain games draw out crafting in a way that is insanely vital for late game, and not easy enough to grasp at an early level but in my opinion new world provides all of the information needed to make your next tool, or craft your next weapon, hell even making a satchel to store all of your goodies you collect. The economy is ever changing and theres is always a new and interesting way to make gold and push towards your next house, weapon, armor, or hell even a new drumset!

NBA 2K25,2878980,178674863,"I've been buying NBA 2K games since the ESPN days, on and off, purely for offline play. I was so happy to see PC was getting next-gen for the mods and the roster editing community's potential. 

Sadly, I have to say I don't remember a version of NBA 2K that left game breaking (offline) bugs in for so long. If you play offline, you want your game to feel realistic, but sadly :
- you first have to jump through a hundred hoops to change settings before every single game, 
- rotations are still messed up (CPU putting G-league guys on the bench instead of better players), 
- defensive matchups are still busted after each timeout which makes it hell to sort out 10x a game since you can't disable CPU timeouts. 
It's just a mess when you actually play the games which should be the essence of the game, right ? 

This isn't even starting to get into the MyNBA Eras problems such as player progression (I'd actually found settings to work around those), draft class attributes randomly changing.

The game is a purposeful grind, but it is designed around the grinding being fun, engaging, and socially rewarding, unlike other grindy games that abuse your FOMO and other marketing strategies to maximise engagement. This game HAS a grind, but you will be smiling and chatting happily all the way through it and in the end the grind is worth it to look back on all the little fishies you've reeled in.

The fishing minigame, a gaming classic, is actually a rather unique one. Its a bit different from the classic ""click when the water moves"" but its also a bit less complicated than the ""keep the dot on the line"" style like Stardew Valley uses. The minigame is able to be done entirely with a single button (left mouse) which makes this a very nice game to play while eating, watching a show, etc.

WEBFISHING,3146520,177620062,"[h1]Get Fish. Sell Fish. Talk Nonsense.[/h1]

A simple, low poly Animal Crossing like fishing game based around a cute little island with different fishing spots. There's not a huge amount of depth, simple goals to complete and it's 5 bucks which on the surface seems like a game without much to do.

But on the contrary [b]the vibe is immaculate[/b]. This game is multiplayer first and while their is no active collaborative mechanics the true joy in this game comes from basically treating the multiplayer as a chill chatroom where people shoot the shit while they fish together. The colourful aesthetic combined with the customisation options and the handful of various toys to let players be expressive and communicative makes it bizarrely easy to spend hours just standing in one place casting a rod and playing a very simply mini game to pick up fish because you're just enjoying hanging out with other people and the creators know this. There are upgrades and alike that support and allow for a much more passive form of game where you can cast your rod then go and get yourself a drink, or have a smoke or something and anything you catch on your line will wait until you come back to your keyboard to interact with the game.

The visuals, the clothing, the overall feel of the game very much tends towards the early 30's millennial mindset who grew up failing at learning to skate, listening to pop punk and wearing chains on the belt loops of their jeans.

WEBFISHING,3146520,177862096,"Strikethrough text ([strike] example [/strike]) means a point is no longer valid as of the most recent update and will be removed soon. Please let me know if I missed something. [b] Bold [/b] means something new from the most recent update.

Here are some things that I feel are important to know and/or that I wanted to know before I bought this game:

MOST IMPORTANT: This game currently does *not* have cloud saves. So if you're playing on PC and want to play on your steam deck, prepare to start all over again. This is by far the biggest negative i've found with this game yet. [b] Going off the 1.09 patchnotes, this will be addressed soon [/b]

Other things:

• There is no voice chat. (this can be a positive or negative depending on player)
• There can be up to 12 players in a server. [b] You can now make the max player count lower when setting up a server. [/b]
• The fishing minigame requires rapid mouse clicking. [b] There is an autoclicker that can be enabled in the settings to help with this. [/b]
• Servers are hosted by players for free. If the host disconnects, the whole server closes.
• There are 4 settings for server privacy: Public, Code-only, [b]Friends-only[/b] and Offline/Solo. Anyone in a public or code lobby can obtain or share the code to share with others. The lobby code is a 6 digit code for example ""FOU2HR"".
• [b] You can mark your server as ""18+"". This doesn't change anything gameplay wise, but it is shown on the server listing as well as making a pop-up appear for players who join your server that they need to accept. [/b]
• There is no lobby descriptions, what you can see before you join is: the host's name and the playercount, formatted as ""TheQuackinator4's Lobby [4/12]"" [b] You can change the server name as well as of 1.09, as well as being able to see if the host has set the server to 18+. [/b]
• The host can kick or ban players
• You can mute and hide players
• Players can punch eachother, including into the water. This can be disabled for you in the settings.
• The game chat seems to have a similar culture to MMOs, for better or worse. The public lobbies are very much not for younger and/or more sensitive players.
• Adding on to the previous point, as the ""mature content description"" on the steam page mentions, the game itself contains some mild swearing and jokes that wouldn't be appropriate for younger players.
• While the game doesn't seem to save between devices, if you leave or are removed from a server, any progress you made on that server does save on that device, so you don't need to worry about restarting every time
• You can draw and erase stuff in certain areas of the game, including being able to draw over and erase other players' drawings.
• If you don't use a code, the public servers you join/host seem to be in your region, as practically all players I've encountered in public servers turned out to be in Denmark, which I am too. So your experience with other players may dramatically depend on where you're located. I don't know how locally it matches players with you, whether it's in the same country or near where you live.
• [strike] This game keeps ALL chat history from your current session and will not delete any chat history until you close and reopen the game. After alot of chatting, I've found that interacting with the chat window makes the game slow to a crawl and the chat scroll bar becomes like, one pixel tall. I do not know if there's a way to delete chat history without restarting the game. [/strike]

Have any more things you want to know before you buy the game?

It's like a mix of games like Boku no Natsuyasumi and Animal Crossing, so if you are fond of either franchise, you'd be crazy not to get this game right now.

Not only it looks like a game from the very early 2000s, it is niche enough for not every popular streamer to be playing and spoiling everything to everyone via YouTube thumbnail on your YouTube homepage. 

This makes this game possible to experience like the old days where you'd figure something out and hold onto that precious information so you can tell everyone at school the next day.

It has no meta, there is no right way to play it, no stress involved whatsoever. It's just fun to find out things by exploring and experimenting.

The community (AKA randos that join your lobby if you choose to leave it open) so far has been wonderful. There are no mechanics designed so that others can ruin your fun, so they just join to roam around and fish together.

Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.

It's roots are lackluster and borderlining creatively bankrupt. It didn't help how it's lead director at the time, the infamous Mio, had a taste for harsh game mechanics that are, self-appointedly, ""worthy of a player’s anger"" (his regards on the Techie, shortly after it was released as a miserably overtuned pest (Techie was rebalanced and is really cool now)). Naturally, such a smug approach to core balance with disrespect to previous titles and traditions did not well flavor this crock of shit. 

I did not experience this game on launch. I am experiencing it now. Adaptive armor massively helps my enjoyment with it's ability to soak chip damage. The new skill lines are interesting and innovative. The DLC is goated (Deagle is objectively overpowered, even among primaries). 

When Almir said that Starbreeze is now able to start working on the core identity of PD3, polishing and rebalancing (like it should have launched as if you're asking for 40 fucking USD), I'm inclined to believe they've already started.

PAYDAY 3,1272080,177321198,"It's hard for me to recommend this but I deeply want to

This is a sequel to Payday 2, and a disappointing one.
Ignoring the content drought, there are still other many problems that add up.

Progression:
Broken. At launch it was slow and boring, now it's insanely fast and boring.
U get levels way too quick, pretty sure u can get to the max level in like 10/20 hours. After which there are only cosmetics to unlock.

Gameplay:
Major stepdown from any of the previous entries in the series no doubt.
Payday: The Heist was slow and methodical
Payday 2 was lightning fast where you got to cause pleanty of choas
Payday 3 tries to be slow like PD:TH while wanting to captivate on the PD2 community by adding things like sliding and vaulting to speed things up, but it's still slow at the core. All this results in a game that's too slow to be fast, and too fast to feel fun while playing slow.

The armour system is completely different from what the series always had. There are plenty of people who explained why it sucks so I won't do it.

Skills are all boring with most of them don't add much. Even in PD:TH which was known for always having the same gameplay with skills that just gave more armour and less recoilt, skills felt more impactful.

Heists are meant to be beat quickly in 10-15 minutes (which feels like a CoD match), a drastic contrast from the 30-50 minutes from PD2. They're all bigger than ever in the series to accompany the fast movement, which just ends up making them feel to big with how slow everything else is.

Gunplay is the only thing that seems to be an upgrade from the previous games, not that it's hard to beat since they run on a Playstation 2 racing game engine.

Enemies weirdly feel less threatening besides the Dozer. Tazers (or Zapers) never taze people. Naders die before they do anything. Shields are still pushovers but less annoying. Snipers barely ever appear to realize they have been improved. Cloakers were overhauled just for them to be spammed making them annoying. The Bulldozer is scary for the wrong reason, breaking armour possibly making the player vulnerable until the end of the heist, which can and will feel bullshit. The Techie being the only new enemy, barely ever appears, and is just there to make people move around, once again, giving the illusion of fast game in a slow one.
 
UI/HUD
UPDATE: The UI has been remade, in menus it now resembles PD2 which is good because that UI worked well but also kinda disappointing to not see much improvement.
The end of heist UI no longer completely sucks but still looks generic as fuck despite the change.
SERVER BROWSER 1 YEAR AFTER RELEASE APPLAUSE EVERYBODY APPLAUSE!
The HUD feels empty. In the Beta it had a sort curve like fish eye lenses which looked pretty cool and after release that effect was removed, character portraits were added to everyone in the lobby. They were so lazily implemented they don't even have masks on, it's just 4 images of people next to 2 bars. Speaking of bars, the armor and health bar hasn't changed since the Beta yet with the addition of these portraits the whole thing still looks like a knockoff.

Art style:
Unreal Engine project nr.209374.
We've all seen this, it has nothing special going for it besides filters, which were proven to be a bad decision for how they can end up making one thing on screen looking good and the rest bad.
Ex.: Oil room in Boys in Blue, Fear and Greed stock exchange room

Soundtrack:
Good, but not excellent like in PD2. Some tracks almost feel rushed. Boys in Blue's assault track sounds like a control track 70% of it. It ramps up somewhere in the middle for like 30 seconds and then calms down. This also applies to many other post launch tracks. The launch tracks didn't seem to have this consistency issue adding to the suspicion. The only launch track that felt unfinished was the one in touch the sky, where u can easily hear the forcely cut transition from anticipation to assault.

Content:
Throughout these 10/20 hours u'll get a decent weapon roaster, but they're not unique enough for them to feel different and it's just a ""decent"" amount meaning that quantity won't save this like in Payday 2. Overall, u'll have everything related to gameplay in no time and u'll experience all of it in less time.

Conclusion:
This could have been good, it really could have.
New engine, new possibilities, with more money invested than any other Starbreeze game, it just ended up as nothing.
It just feels like modern CoD (balancing, dev's priorities, cosmetics, movement), Payday (gameplay basis, AI, universe, partially map design) and many good ideas got mashed together into an incoherent mess.

FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE,39210,178427482,"I'm in my mid-40s, and have never played an online game until last year. I'd heard too many horror stories, and honestly, I was worried I wouldn't be able to manage the keyboard controls. My left hand is mostly brain dead. 

I jumped into gaming last year for Palia. While there's a much longer story to be told there, I will just say that the thing I was doing to try to relax and escape from the hellish timeline we're all living in, became more frustration than fun, more exasperation than escape. I stuck with it for a bit over a year, still hoping it would eventually become what the OG team had promoted. 

It won't. Not ever. 

So I asked some other players what game I should try next, and the most overwhelmingly consistent response was FFXIV. 

I started the free trial last week. I was terrified of the combat, and of having so many new things to learn, but found myself sucked in, all the same. Now, I will unashamedly say I am hooked through the bag. 

The story is captivating, and keeps me on the edge of my seat as I progress through the MSQ and gradually piece together the epic, sweeping history of Eorzea and all her climes and cultures, magic and mystery. I care about the world and the races that dwell within it, and want to know everything they will tell me. I care about how my efforts are intertwined with the main conflict that propels the plot forward and outward in an ever expanding, ever shifting, inescapably immersive lore.

The artwork for both characters and landscapes is mind boggling in its beauty, complexity, and variety. For the first week, I don't think I've managed to play for a single hour without gasping in awe as I summit some new horizon and experience a new part of Eorzea for the first time, or without grinning in delight at some tiny detail that I very nearly missed. 

The mechanics are immense, but masterfully introduced so that even the newbiest newb can fairly easily and almost entirely naturally learn as they play. Believe me, if I could understand all of the different systems in place in less than a week, anyone can. Yet those systems and mechanics, at least so far, don't feel stale or boring or rote, and there is always a challenge to be had for those who are driven by that need.

I've never reviewed a game before, and I definitely didn't intend to compose a novella, but I couldn't wait another moment to sing the praises of one of the most skillfully - and obviously passionately - created worlds I've ever encountered in any sort of fiction, in my 40+ years of reading fantasy and scif, and watching shows and movies in the same genres. 

I only wish I could rate it higher!

FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE,39210,178458100,"The game has plenty of old content to keep you busy for years!
The MSQ is worthwhile up to a point and very immersive and engaging.
The community are willing to give new players help to learn the ropes and there's always something different, interesting or downright disturbing happening in the party finder at most hours.
However, this and the last expansion have been a major drop off for me and I've lost a good amount of friends who didn't return for DT because of the lack luster output of content during EW, and after the friends I remained in contact with heard about the mess that they made of the MSQ with DT they don't look like they'll be returning at all.
EW's MSQ was amazing! But I feel that SE let us down with a huge lack of content, which was stingy at best. And at least in my opinion and many who I've spoken to, DT let us down BADLY with the worst MSQ of any of the previous expansions by far.
The long dry spells of new content are too long, and at one point I felt, with how popular the game had gotten that they'd be releasing more content with each expansion, not less and more of the same...
I fail to see where the subs are going cos it's not going back into this title the way it should be in order to keep their customers busy and coming back.
It's the same timetable as the last two expansions, same amount of dungeons, all be them a little more difficult than the yawn fests of the last two expansions but they've very quickly gotten boring as well.

Do you like having all classes and crafting jobs available on the same character with easy equipment set changing? Do you like an intricate crafting system with engaging interactive mechanics that could honestly be a game in themselves?

THEN DON'T TOUCH FINAL FANTASY XIV!

Don't get me wrong, it does have all of those things, but if they are what you are looking for, you're in for a rude awakening. Because the game is a story game first and foremost. It doesn't *also* have a story, as an option if you're interested. No, it IS a story game.

If you like stories and/or this story specifically? Cool! Amazing! From all I heard and what little I've seen, I think it's a great story and there's years and years of amazing story content to enjoy. If that's for you, you can stop reading, because this review isn't for you. But if you are anything like me, if the main thing you want out of this game is any or all of the things I mentioned initially and story is - at most - a nice little side dish you may want to dip into occasionally, then: This game isn't made for you.

You'll HAVE to play the story to very slowly, painstakingly pry access to those things you ACTUALLY want to do out of the game's claws. It doesn't want you to get there. Not before you know ~The Story~ of every little thing you get. Can't access a dungeon before knowing its historical relevance. Can't learn an ability without listening to some dude out in bumf*ck nowhere telling you how to attune your holy dragonsoul to the ancient teachings of ""finally I have combo finisher at level 30, now can I get a single AoE ability please"".

And don't believe skipping is a serious option. Sure, you can. But you gotta skip every speech bubble individually. Wait for them to finish their animations, because you can't skip those. Wait for every loading screen for a cutscene individually before you get to skip it. And once you skipped that, your reward is that you get to go to the other side of the world to talk to a guy, skip it all, then return - and then you'll do it again! (At least the teleporting ability is cheap and readily available everywhere...) The only serious skip is the paid full story skip up to the current expansion. However that's 20€ PLUS what you pay for the expansion + base game. A hefty sum for a game that seemingly doesn't even want people like us playing it.

Fights are rare in the Main Story Quest (MSQ), you're mostly just talking. Occasionally you're forced to go through a dungeon or raid, which is easy enough with the group finder - high levels will join you and get scaled down, so there's always enough people around - but to me it's still often a slap in the face. When I play, I play what I'm in the mood for. If I'm in the mood for dungeons, I do dungeons. If I'm in the mood for skipping through the story to maybe finally get ever so slightly closer to the endgame I crave, I don't want to suddenly do a raid.

Oh and just as an extra little f*ck you, if you're actually playing with somebody else, you'll regularly have to disband the group, because there's a lot of solo instanced content in the MSQ that you can't do with a group at all. Just dancing to the whims of the designers - one second you need to be alone, one second you need 23 other people with you.

While leveling, side quests - and arguably also dungeons and any other content at some point - are *mechanically* useless, because if you're not focusing the MSQ hard, you'll quickly outlevel your content. It's not a *problem* technically, because you'll just get scaled down and can still participate. You'll even still level up. But there's no actual progress. Being max level is completely useless if you didn't do the COMPLETE MSQ FOR THE BASEGAME AND EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION to unlock all the content for max level. You can't even go to those areas without getting to that point in the MSQ.

I'm 150h in at this point (if you're doing the math: 40h were on the free demo) and I'm allegedly close to finishing the BASEGAME story quest. (I still don't fully believe it, because I was allegedly close to it 50h ago already.) And that's with skipping most story content - first out of disinterest, then out of spite. Though admittedly, I took longer breaks to just do dungeons (even without the xp being of any use), get into crafting (which is actually REALLY cool) and leveling other classes to keep myself sane.

But still, while it can be done faster: Even if you plan to skip the whole story, it will be a soulless GRIND. Walk to some guy, skip skip skip skip. Skip cutscene, skip skip skip. Teleport to the other side of the world. Walk/ride a bit because next guy isn't close to the teleporter. Skip skip skip skip. Skip cutscene. And you'll do that for hours. This game can't even give you a CRAFTING quest without 10 speech bubbles of story content.

I'm too deep in. I got a taste of what the game can do. I hate crafting in other games, I love it here. While I still prefer combat mechanics in other games, I really want to get into this one deeper, because it is definitely very good. And last but not least... my girlfriend plays and loves this game and I really, really, really want to get to a point where I can share that enjoyment with her. I see why she does, I just can't quite reach it yet...

I can't let this game go, but hell... it's draining. The designers have built great mechanics that I love and want to explore and yet I have to fight them every step to be allowed access to them. One thing is very clear: They designed a story game. Not a mechanics game. And if you don't submit to the story they want to tell, you'll suffer.

It might be worth it. I sure hope it will be at some point. I'm sure the story is good too, if you're willing to engage with it. But I wasn't and by now I'm too spiteful and jaded. So much so that I can't even buy the story skip. The idea of rewarding this design that feels so intentionally hostile towards me specifically with extra money makes my blood boil.

If you're still here, I hope this read was worth it, too. For me it was honestly mostly therapeutical. Trying to get it off my chest, hoping to find the motivation to continue trying. If it helped you, I'm glad.",do you like dungeons and raids with a clean and nicely readable interface for boss mechanics do you like classes with intricate combos and weaving in offglobal cooldown

Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178142535,"Waited 9 years for a new instalment of Dragon Age series, one of my all time favourite game franchises! I've always been a fan of Bioware games, like Mass Effect, and OG Baldur's Gate. And I replayed ALL the DA games ready and in anticipation of DAV. I am both saddened and mad at the state of this game!! 

Lets start off with the things I'm glad about:

- Romance any of the companions (honestly felt that this should have been in all the games) 
- Better hair styles
- Even on lowest graphics it looks like DAI on ultra (though that was 10 years old at this point) 
- You can pet cats and dogs you find in your travels, not all but some (edit)

Cons:

- Characters feel samey - they really don't have anything to distinguish themselves from each other, and feel very much like a click where everyone loves everyone and gets alone with no issues.
- Back to DAO days of corridor running
- Puzzles are lacking/non-existent
- Combat is dull, boring and lacks skills to use on the battlefield - by this in DAI you could have up to 8 skills on your hot bar when using controller and still be able to command your party. You get one less companion and only 3 skills this time round, making combat a ""smash x to win""
- No dalish option for your character if your run elf - this feels like a HUGE miss 
- Lack of character development for both PC and companions
- No real renegade options - I miss being able to choose if i wanted a lawful good run or just pure chaos
- approval system is just pointless 
- Lore completely retconned - Everything I knew about DA (literally replayed all 3 games so many times cos of my love for the games) was thrown out of a window and stamped on. Feels more like a 12 year old girl's fanfic than a real lore driven game. 
- Story lack luster, feels all choices I made in previous games to create a world state was pointless, and while I understand after all this time would be hard to integrate DAV in to something like DragonsKeep I feel they should have given us more choices to add in that would MATTER to the game state. Not only that the story feels stale, uninteresting and just weak. Even DA2 was better than this and we all know that had a weak story with bad pacing, this is 100% times worse!!
- I felt patronised as a player by how the characters talked down to me even Varric when that has never been his personality.
- Character assassinated previous characters from how they speak, to how they behaved.
- This is not a ""progressive"" game, the original 3 games where progressive, this felt very regressive and a lot of pointless real world politics added in a distasteful way, that it was uncomfortable for me to play through, and I'm a female, bisexual, demisexual, disabled person that is usually all for progressive games, instead this was not what I got. Instead I was forced to endure very patronising cutscenes and waste time on things that have no bareings on a world ending crisis/story line. 
- Character creation, while better than previous instalments, was still bad. No matter how hard I tried to make my lady elf look good she still felt like a man in the face. Body I couldn't care less about, as the body wasn't really an option in previous games, always the same body shape and we always had gender neutral armour on anyway so I didn't care, but the face... Good gosh that was aweful... 
- Heads of all characters STILL look too large, body proportions where all over the place and looked odd and wonky. Just over all not a fan of this more cartoon look, but I could have lived with this IF this was the only con. 

Over all this has been one of the most uncomfortable games I've played through. I was so desperate for a new DA game, that I preordered the deleux edition of this game, and was so excited for this. As I mentioned earlier in this, it really does feel like someone's fanfic, that removes everything they disliked about DA (so all of the set lore and previous story) and wrote how they felt the game should end. I wish I could defend this game but I really can't and it breaks my heart. This was meant to be a continuation of the already outlined story from the first 3 games instead this doesn't even feel like the same franchise anymore. 

I get the old DA devs didn't work on this game (they don't even work at Bioware anymore) so I expected some changes/retcons, but this... This is a terrible joke, and a F--- you to the fans. The game has 0 idea what it is telling, what it wants to be, or anything. I feel at this point the game would have been better recieved had they started from scratch with Origins and rebooted the series OR better yet, just created a whole new franchise, new story and stayed away from a beloved franchise. I am usually fine with changes in games/stories but there needs to be a reason for it, it needs to be better than what came before, even if its just testing waters and flops. But I can't sit here and defend or excuse what this mess is.

While I doubt my view will change, I still plan to finish this game to see how much else has been ruined, I will NEVER recommend this game, and I pray no one buys this game as a loud message needs to be set to companies about pulling these stunts.",waited  years for a new instalment of dragon age series one of my all time favourite game franchises ive always been a fan of bioware games like mass

Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178412485,"I beat the game. It took about 62 hours to do so and my biggest takeaway from this game is that this isn't a BioWare game. 

BioWare made it's name on ""your choices matter"", then boiled down 200 hours of content down to three questions and destroyed every former region in what feels like a scorched earth attempt to say ""We're done here, stop asking about things from Origins/2/Inquisition because they're dead and now there's no going back"" and that nothing that we did in those three previous games mattered because it's all gone now anyway. 

It feels BAD. It feels like a betrayal and sellout for a modern take and a fresh audience who aren't going to care about those things. If you're new to the franchise, you may enjoy it, the combat is formatted to align with more modern games and if the vibes match what you want, then go for it, but if you're a longtime Dragon Age fan looking forward to this game, my biggest and most stern recommendation is to not play it. It will not meet your expectations and will ruin what love you had remaining for the company. 

Go back and play Origins instead.",i beat the game it took about  hours to do so and my biggest takeaway from this game is that this isnt a bioware game bioware made its name on your choices matter then boiled down  hours of content down to three questions and destroyed every former region in what feels like a scorched earth attempt to say were done here stop asking about things from originsinquisition because theyre dead and now theres no going back and that nothing that we did in those three previous games mattered because its all gone now anyway it feels bad it feels like a betrayal and sellout for a modern take and a fresh audience who arent going to care about those things if youre new to the franchise you may enjoy it the combat is formatted to align with more modern games and if the vibes match what you want then go for it but if youre a longtime dragon age fan looking forward to this game my biggest and most stern recommendation is to not play it it will not meet your expectations and will ruin what love you had remaining for the company go back and play origins instead,NEG,,
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178127744,"I will edit this review if my opinion changes as I play. I am 4 hours in and I still don't feel like the game has started. My immersion in a Dragon Age game has legitimatly never been lower than these 4 hours. Player agency is non existent, I don't feel like I've gotten any opportunity to RP, or develop my character at all. I have no idea who this dude is, I don't feel like a part of the world, and the characters all blur together into a singular lifeless entity. Everything feels like a set, you get plopped into scenes at a rapid pace with no chance to explore. There has genuinely never been another game in the series that has felt so completely on rails and uninterested in letting the player actually interact with it. And the dialogue. Oh god. Not even just the player's, which is abysmal, but the dialogue in general is written so badly. Characters repeat themselves over, and over again like you're too stupid to have heard them the first time. Here is an example of what I mean (paraphrased but the gist is there): 

Character A: we’re searching for the Nadas Dirthalan! It’s an archive spirit. 
Character B: Nadas Dirthalan?
Character A: Yes! It’s a spirit that can tell us all about the ancient elves history!

A few minutes later

Character A: We’re close to the Archive Spirit! I have so many questions to ask it. 

Another few minutes later, we meet it, it disappears.

Character B: Well it’s broken like all the other artifacts here.
Character A: it’s not just any artifact! It’s the Nadas Dirthalan! The Archive Spirit! I have so many questions to ask it!

*fade to black, teleported to new location* 

Character A: blah blah something something Nadas Dirthalan
Character C: Wait! You met the Nadas Dirthalan? The Archive Spirit? We could ask it about the ancient elven gods!

If they aren't repeating exposition/objectives at you, they're using the most corny and predictable filler dialogue. How many times have you heard ""It's quiet here... TOO QUIET."" cuz it's got that. I wouldn't be surprised to hear a ""He's standing right behind me isn't he"" or a ""Well that just happened."" I guess this is what we're left with when EA decides to fire their best writers for the series.

8 hours in and I still couldn't tell you a single thing about these characters beyond one or two word descriptions. I could list a fact or two about them, but I really am getting absolutely no personality off them. Everyone feels so cardboard. The only character with a shred of personality is almost entirely due to the talent of the voice actress portraying her, working hard with a piss poor script. 

Part of me feels awful, hating this game so much. I want to make it clear that zero of the reasons to hate this game have to do with inclusion or ""wokeness."" I wish people would stop making it about that, it's a nothing criticism, it's an entirely artificial conflict, and it's made the fanbase into yes men who refuse to look at the game critically or accept anything but praise for what is so obviously a lazy game devoid of anything that made these games compelling. To the people who decry this game out of bigotry alone: the Dragon Age series has always included explicit queer identity and giving the player more options to express that aspect of their own character is a positive in my book. Having more LGBT characters or options for players to explore their own character's identity in a game does nothing to you. Get over yourself. Unfortunately, it's in a shit game that has no place calling itself part of what was an incredible trilogy, and yes, for all of DA2's short comings, it is still leagues better than this game. There is a STARK contrast between the two, actually. DA2 had a ridiculously rushed production, had ambitions it couldn't deliver on because of executive meddling and STILL managed to tell an incredible story with rich, memorable characters. And then those talented writers got fired or left, and we got to wait an entire decade for a polished turd.",i will edit this review if my opinion changes as i play i am  hours in and i still dont feel like the game has started my immersion in a dragon age game has legitimatly never been lower than these  hours player agency is non existent i dont feel like ive gotten any opportunity to rp or develop my character at all i have no idea who this dude is i dont feel like a part of the world and the characters all blur together into a singular lifeless entity everything feels like a set you get plopped into scenes at a rapid pace with no chance to explore there has genuinely never been another game in the series that has felt so completely on rails and uninterested in letting the player actually interact with it and the dialogue oh god not even just the players which is abysmal but the dialogue in general is written so badly characters repeat themselves over and over again like youre too stupid to have heard them the first time here is an example of what i mean paraphrased but the gist is there character a were searching for the nadas dirthalan its an archive spirit character b nadas dirthalan character a yes its a spirit that can tell us all about the ancient elves history a few minutes later character a were close to the archive spirit i have so many questions to ask it another few minutes later we meet it it disappears character b well its broken like all the other artifacts here character a its not just any artifact its the nadas dirthalan the archive spirit i have so many questions to ask it fade to black teleported to new location character a blah blah something something nadas dirthalan character c wait you met the nadas dirthalan the archive spirit we could ask it about the ancient elven gods if they arent repeating expositionobjectives at you theyre using the most corny and predictable filler dialogue how many times have you heard its quiet here too quiet cuz its got that i wouldnt be surprised to hear a hes standing right behind me isnt he or a well that just happened i guess this is what were left with when ea decides to fire their best writers for the series  hours in and i still couldnt tell you a single thing about these characters beyond one or two word descriptions i could list a fact or two about them but i really am getting absolutely no personality off them everyone feels so cardboard the only character with a shred of personality is almost entirely due to the talent of the voice actress portraying her working hard with a piss poor script part of me feels awful hating this game so much i want to make it clear that zero of the reasons to hate this game have to do with inclusion or wokeness i wish people would stop making it about that its a nothing criticism its an entirely artificial conflict and its made the fanbase into yes men who refuse to look at the game critically or accept anything but praise for what is so obviously a lazy game devoid of anything that made these games compelling to the people who decry this game out of bigotry alone the dragon age series has always included explicit queer identity and giving the player more options to express that aspect of their own character is a positive in my book having more lgbt characters or options for players to explore their own characters identity in a game does nothing to you get over yourself unfortunately its in a shit game that has no place calling itself part of what was an incredible trilogy and yes for all of das short comings it is still leagues better than this game there is a stark contrast between the two actually da had a ridiculously rushed production had ambitions it couldnt deliver on because of executive meddling and still managed to tell an incredible story with rich memorable characters and then those talented writers got fired or left and we got to wait an entire decade for a polished turd,NEG,,
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178471113,"Dragon Age The Veilguard is a lot like Mass Effect Andromeda, arguably the best combat in the series, (Although I much prefer my RTWP) Stunning graphics and environmental design, and never feels cumbersome to actually play. But, also like Andromeda, Veilguard suffers from abysmal, sterilized, and insultingly safe writing, little to no actual ability to shape your character's personality, and a complete disconnection to choices and events of past games in the series which made sense for Andromeda with the whole switching galaxies thing. 

Veilguard almost feels afraid to mention any of the past games in a meaningful way, Characters like Morrigan and Harding who return don't feel or look like themselves, Harding in particular feeling 10 years younger than herself in Inquisition, returning characters can only mention past games in a vague way, you can't ask any of these characters any thing worthwhile.  BioWare throws away one of their more interesting villains in Solas in the first 10 minutes of the game just to be replaced by 2 generically and cartoonishly evil bad guys. 

I wish Steam allowed mixed review scores for times like this because their is truly a good game here for people, but this feels like a spit in the face for me and lot of fans who have been waiting 10 years for the culmination and finale of 3 entire games worth of story lines and character arcs.",dragon age the veilguard is a lot like mass effect andromeda arguably the best combat in the series although i much prefer my rtwp stunning graphics and environmental design and never feels cumbersome to actually play but also like andromeda veilguard suffers from abysmal sterilized and insultingly safe writing little to no actual ability to shape your characters personality and a complete disconnection to choices and events of past games in the series which made sense for andromeda with the whole switching galaxies thing veilguard almost feels afraid to mention any of the past games in a meaningful way characters like morrigan and harding who return dont feel or look like themselves harding in particular feeling  years younger than herself in inquisition returning characters can only mention past games in a vague way you cant ask any of these characters any thing worthwhile bioware throws away one of their more interesting villains in solas in the first  minutes of the game just to be replaced by  generically and cartoonishly evil bad guys i wish steam allowed mixed review scores for times like this because their is truly a good game here for people but this feels like a spit in the face for me and lot of fans who have been waiting  years for the culmination and finale of  entire games worth of story lines and character arcs,NEG,,
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178399292,"Edit: I turned on easy mode and cleared the game. Finished all companion quests and got what I'd consider the ""best"" ending possible. My takeaway is that this is a game written for nobody. This is a reboot billed as a sequel: It REQUIRES knowledge of the series for it's plot to have any emotional impact - yet constantly goes out of it's way to show it's contempt for the lore and previous entries. How could this please anyone? Dragon Age was my first exposure to the Fantasy genre, I care deeply for these stories - and at this point I just hope they don't parade it's corpse around again.

To clarify, I'm not some oldhead DAO purist or a grifter. Origins, 2, and Inquisition all have their respective major faults - but I could always look past them, when the world and story was crafted with such love and care. Veilguard in comparison is soulless drivel, lacking in any nuance. It's unwilling to present any real emotional or intellectual conflict to the player - in a setting that, in many ways, is defined by it's ability to evoke these feelings. 


I got past the simplification of combat.
I got past the cartoon Darkspawn.

But the writing is an insult to anyone that has had any investment in Dragon Age as a series. 

The phrase “marvel tier writing” is overused, but it does apply here. It’s not that quippy dialogue is inherently bad. It’s that everything they’ve presented, be it dialogue, lore exposition, all of it - is HEAVILY sanitized. In far too many instances, the writing is amateurishly immersion breaking. It feels like HR is present in the background of every interaction. This isn't targeting inclusivity. Dragon Age has always been vocally inclusive and I love it for that - but Veilguard is so hamfisted it proves itself the most regressive of all 4 entries. 

Each returning character feels like a half-baked cardboard cutout, a caricature. Why even bring Morrigan or Dorian back if you’re going to strip them of everything that connected us as players to their stories. These moments that should be amazing - seeing these characters again after 10 years, don’t just fall flat - they feel like an insult to the characters themselves.

A lot of blame is deservedly placed on corporate level decisions, but when your writing staff is so fundamentally out of touch with the setting - there was no hope in the first place.

DA2 did it in the same 3 caves with a box of scraps (and like 1/15th of the dev time)

Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178237923,"Disappointment and wasted potential:

The good:
Runs very well, very smooth, not a single bug or stutter in 12 hours of gameplay.
The visual design of the levels and environments and the atmosphere of the big set pieces. They look and feel big and apocalyptic.
Character creation, visually has alot of options and room to make your PC look the way you want. Hair in particular looks very lifelike.

The bad:
The Combat - Is mediocre at best, whilst the visuals and animations are quite flashy, it feels like a dumbed down version of Inquisitions combat. It gets boring and repetitive within a few hours. I turned the difficulty down after a few hours so I could get through it more quickly. Gone is the tactical combat and engineered party synergy of previous games.

The Story - Feels like it has the skeleton of compelling, intriguing narrative full of secrets revlealed, moral ambiguity and challenging decisions. However it's like it's been simplified to the level of a child's cartoon or a by the numbers phase 4 Marvel movie. This get's so frustrating because there are so many points that have the glimmer of a truly great and compelling RPG, but at every turn it feels like they fall short and fail to realise that potential. The DA setting has been built up as such well realised world with a compelling history full of mystery. Veilguard reveals answers alot of those mysteries but how they do it cheapens and taints everything that came before.

The Gear - Reminds me of a bad Korean MMO. Combine duplicate gear to upgrade it and give it more stats? Really? Where's the going on an epic quest to find a legendary sword etc? The immersion and investment?

The Worst:
The Characters & Dialogue - This is what I expect to be the high point of a Bioware game. So many times they have created compelling, well drawn casts of characters that form a web of friendship, rivalry, romance etc that I couldnt help but get entangled in. In this Veilguard fails completely. Many of the characters have alot of potential and interesting concepts, but it's rolled flat by childish, wooden dialogue. Solas is the only character that is interesting at all and much of that I suspect is just because of the build up of the previous game. This is the biggest disappointment, the game totally failed to make me invested in any of the characters in any way. The might as well have been characters in a commercial.

Conclusion:
As a fan of the series this is a huge disappointment. Ever since finishing Inquisition I've looked forward to this game yet now I've had to stop playing around 13 hours in because the game has just become a tiresome chore. Given that I replayed each of the previous installments multiple times (even DA2!). Worse this actively taints the previous games, knowing where all the tension and mystery they build is headed.

Give this one a miss unless its on a massive discount.

Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178146219,"EDIT: After four hours, my opinion of the game has only gotten worse. You can tell that this was a live service game at one point. The combat and abilities feel very MMO-like, and they have a floaty-ness that feels unsatisfying. A lot of my other opinions are spoilers, so I'll leave those on the table...Fans of Origins are going to be frustrated, though.

Original Review:

It's...fine. Just fine. I'm going to get into some spoilers for Inquisition in this review, and some very minor spoilers for the first hour or so of Veilguard. You've been warned.

Look, I'm a software engineer myself. When I play this game, I can tell that the team behind it worked WONDERS behind the scenes. This is one of the single most stable AAA games released in years -- It's definitely way more stable than Inquisition was when it was released. I've yet to encounter any serious bugs. The frame pacing is stellar. Even with Ultra Ray Tracing enabled, the game just RUNS. It's a technical marvel what they've been able to do with Frostbite -- an engine that used to have a reputation for being impossible to work with if you weren't making a Battlefield game. On a technical level, this product is really something to be proud of. 

But we don't come to Dragon Age for its technical prowess, do we? I haven't played much yet, so I'm going to give this game a chance. If by the end of the game it manages to change my mind, I'll come up and update this review. But, ultimately, this game has fumbled the story on a fundamental level, and I think most Dragon Age fans are going to come away frustrated.

Your character comes out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. That gameplay demo that they showed off a couple months back? That is the start of the game. Nothing happens before you. You're already buddies with Varric. You're already on board with the core conflict of the game. The game makes no effort to set up any reason that YOU, Rook, specifically have an investment in this conflict beyond ""Saving The World."" 

In Inquisition, and Dragon Age: Origins, you were an unwilling participant in the events that make you a hero. In Origins, you were living a mostly happy life until something goes horribly wrong, and you're forced to run away with the Gray Wardens. Then they all die, and you're left the only person left who can save the world.

In Inquisition, you were an attendee at a summit between the Chantry and Mages that was trying to resolve the conflict of Dragon Age 2 (Which I'm leaving out of this discussion because its status among the community is...complicated). The summit is blown to pieces, and you're left with a rift to the veil on your hand as tears begin to open up all over the world. You're the only person with the ability to close these rifts, and so you have to step up and do something. And even if you weren't the only one, you have the mystery of what happened to you as a driving factor.

In Veilguard? Well, you're just kind of there. Presumably Varric dug you out of a gutter somewhere, started doing some missions with you, and by the time the game starts you are somehow aware of everything that's going on and are fully on board with your role in stopping it all. 

And...That's BAFFLING to me. Dragon Age isn't like Mass Effect. They've never carried over the protagonist between games, but to account for that, they ensured that the core conflict of each game was uniquely yours. You were living out a new chapter in the history of Thedas. Your decisions in previous games helped set the stage for you, but you had your OWN motivations for doing what you were doing.

In the Veilguard, the conflict isn't Rook's. It's the Inquisitor's. Solas was one of the inquisitor's closest friends and confidants, and he went on an entire globe-spanning adventure with them in order to save the world. Then, after you've done so...you realize that he was behind everything all along. He was secretly an immortal god of the Elves that created the veil to seal away his fellow gods, tearing magic out of the world and rendering everyone -- and most notably his fellow Elves -- mortal. Thousands of years later, he regrets what he has done and wants to unsever the world and return it to the wonderous state it was in before. He fumbles that at first, and the villain of the main game gets ahold of the MacGuffin that he was going to use to do that...But when you stop him, Solas is now free to pursue other avenues to achieve his goals -- at the cost of countless lives. But he hadn't counted on coming to know you. In finding your companionship.

In the closing act of Inquisition, you are left helplessly confronting Solas as he lays out everything that he is planning, and then he leaves you there to sit with that betrayal. If you are an elf woman, and you romanced Solas, the scene is particularly powerful -- You realize at the same time that Solas is the god that your people abhor, and the person that set in motion the events that set your life ablaze. But you still love him. And you beg him to listen to you, and find another way. But then he leaves. And you swear to follow.

----

And then you don't. Some new smuck does. Bioware has made the decision to continue the conflict from Inquisition, with all of the emotional baggage that comes with it, but they remove all of the people that were involved in that conflict and have something to say about it aside from a handful of returning characters that seem pretty minor so far. This random new smuck is the one confronting Solas for what he did. This random new smuck is the one to chase him down and stop him. And it feels extremely hollow. The story that they are trying to tell is BEGGING for the Inquisitor to be the main character. And I think the developers realize that. In the first 10 minutes of the game, when you confront Solas for the first time...YOU don't do anything, Varric does. Why? Because, however tenuous, Varric has SOME history with Solas, and you have none. You can't confront him because none of that pain is yours...And honestly, not much of it is Varric's either. This game is BEGGING for the Inquisitor to be the one standing there, trying to talk him down.

But for whatever reason, they shot themselves in the foot and made what could have been an incredibly powerful story incredibly hollow by having some random unknown be the person to tie off those threads. Hell, even if they didn't want to bring the Inquistor back, they could have at least spent SOME TIME setting up your character's motivations for being there. Maybe Solas' plans intersect with your life in some way, and now you're the next unwilling participant in your own Dragon Age adventure. But they didn't even do that much. You're some dude that Varric scooped up off the street and set to work solving his problems...And you don't even get to see that much. You're just there. You have a mission. You're a badass. You may have never met him, but you sure do know that this Solas guy needs to be stopped.

I've only played the intro so far, but I felt so incredibly burned by how they decided to set up this game that I feel like it's going to color my thoughts about it going forward. They needed to:

A. Make Solas tangential to the adventure, and give your character his own inciting incident and role in this world.

OR 

B. Make this game a direct sequel to Inquisition, and the Inquisitor the main character.

Instead they tried to mash together a little from column A and column B, and made something that is SO far all around disappointing.

I really hope that this was just an extremely bad introduction to the game and that it gets better. If it does, I'll update this review. But I'm honestly really bummed. This isn't how I wanted the follow up to Dread Wolf to go.",edit after four hours my opinion of the game has only gotten worse you can tell that this was a live service game at one point the combat

Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178390293,"The combat was fun for a time but for a RPG the dialogue and writing ruins the entire game. Its obvious to see the writers have no life experience to draw from since much of the story feels as if it was generated by an AI.

The world is falling apart around you and everyone is unbearably nice about it. Should you choose the ""evil"" option on the dialogue wheel (which is just pragmatism), characters will go as far as to apologise on your behalf should you be too mean.

 There is no sense of urgency in the world and the first major choice in the game came at completely the wrong time. It's impossible to spoil the story, as its terrible, but you are given a choice, between companions and cities. Which one will you help? However the writers, voice artists or world building made no effort to create any attachments to one or the other. Enough to make you hover over the uninstall button and wish you got this game on EA Play. 

You are in a fantasy world that is open for you to explore. However the developers decided to use only exposition after exposition after more exposition to explain this world to you. Between this exposition dialogue you and your companions will constantly pat each other on the back and lie to each other about how awesome the other is. 

Class choices are boring and the abilities of your companions makes you miss the older games that allowed you to control them directly. For instance I wanted a griffon and the abilities it came with but I am forced to drag around a boring character if I want to access that. Companions are only good for their combo abilities. They will often disengage targets or the enemies they do target will still attack you. 

There are many things I could nitpick at, like the warden elf with a cleft lip speaking french randomly or any number of inconsistencies.

Honestly, I don't think I've played a game with writing so bad that it made me actually want *less* banter between companions, but here we are.

Also, one of the early characters talks like a kindergarten teacher.

And the voice acting is pretty bad.  There is a noticeable difference between the voice acting for new characters and for those who were in the other games. 

The art style, particularly the character and monster design, is also pretty terrible, though some of the environments look good.  I think it wouldn't but me so much if the writing was at least good, but between the writing and the art, it feels like it was made for children.

The character motion and fighting feel weirdly floaty.  

Character proportions are really weird thanks to the word art style so everyone looks bizarre and stumpy.

I bought this game against my better judgement in spite of the controversies and in spite of the scathing reviews from Skill Up and Mr Matty Plays because Dragon Age is my favourite gaming series. My first 3 hours were incredible and I was so happy that the game wasn't just not terrible, but actually good! However, after those frontloaded 3 hours, the cracks started to show and those cracks quickly turned into a gaping chasm of mediocrity and I started to realise those two creators told several truths in their reviews. I strongly recommend you check at least one of those out before you buy but, after my first 11 hours, these are MY initial thoughts:

[h2] The Good: [/h2]

[b] - Character Models: [/b] The stylised art was a point of apprehension for me but it grew on me within the first hour. Character models look great. It's easy to create a stunningly beautiful character in the CC and they look just as good in cutscenes which is already an improvement over previous titles. Hair options are awesome.

[b] - The Performance: [/b] Flawless. On my 4080 with everything set to Ultra and all the Ray Tracing, I've had zero hiccups. And so far I've seen no bugs and experienced no crashes. It's been a while since I could say that about a AAA release.

[b] - The Graphics: [/b] Environments look awesome. There was a puddle in the opening mission that blew me away. The reflections, the physics. Chef's kiss.

[h2] The Bad: [/h2]

[b] - Voice Acting: [/b] This is my biggest gripe with the game. It's just incredibly bad and the majority of NPC's have their lines delivered with little to no emotion. I hate talking to companions and NPCs. Neve's is particularly unforgivable given she's one of the first people you meet in the game. I checked out after meeting a character from the comics I had been looking forward to meeting in game for years. Her acting was so bad and her lines were delivered like an NPC quest giver in an MMO. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and caused me to turn off the game.

[b] - The Writing: [/b] It leaves a lot to be desired. Conversations end abruptly as if the writer didn't know where it was going or simply where to take it and often left me asking, ""that's it?"". When my companions give their companion quest, they'll literally say one line of dialogue, giving my Rook no chance to respond and the conversation ends, and a quest is added to my journal. I feel like my Rook barely speaks and when she does, I feel no connection to her as a character. She feels like a passenger in her own story.

[b] - Nuance: [/b] 
Continuing my criticism of the writing I want to bring up self-doubt as it feels like all of my companions have it as does my Rook. The game has just begun and it feels like there's no reason for this. There was a scene early on where my Rook looked in a mirror and reminisced about her past. It became apparent she had self-esteem issues and there was an interesting option where I could talk about my tattoos. This would've been fine if the dialogue options didn't say something cliché like ""this is part of who I am"". As a tattooed person, this came across very forced and I've never once relied on my tattoos for self-esteem. I had a conversation with Varric where every line amounted to ""I can't do this, Varric, I need advice"". I wanted some degree of self confidence in my hero where doubt comes in later in the story due to a major setback. In Mass Effect Shepard began to doubt themself after Virmire, toward the latter part of the game. There was context for this because Virmire felt like a big failure and the bad guy got away. It then took the advice of a squadmate to uplift them and spur them to action. This common story beat instead takes place at the beginning of The Veilguard and it's jarring.

[b] - Side Quests: [/b] I did one side quest and I really don't want to do another one again.

[b] - Squad Balance: [/b] I picked a mage and I'm yet to recruit a single warrior. The game is linear and so far I have 2 mages, including my Rook, and 3 rogues, only one of which is melee focused. Did they assume everybody was going to pick Warrior? As a result my squad is imbalanced and I'm currently serving as my squad's tank. I'm forced to pick electric spells as a necessity because it's the only way I can prime detonations with the current selection party members. I'm particularly annoyed by this because I didn't want to RP as a lightning mage.

[b] - Mission Structure: [/b] It's disjointed. At first it had the linearity of God of War then transitioned into what I seemed like it would be a Mass Effect 2 mission structure but it didn't quite land. It's something really weird that I can't explain and it doesn't feel enjoyable.

[b] - Puzzles: [/b] Some puzzles do require more thinking than Matty and Skill Up gave the impression of. But I don't enjoy them and they feel like unnecessary additions. Not fun, more tedious than anything

[b] - Previous Choices: [/b] Obviously being a fan of all previous games, my choices not carrying over is a huge negative that I was willing to look past if the game was good. So far nothing has been so great as to justify this baffling decision.

[h2] The Ugly: [/h2]

[b] - Combat: [/b] It's fantastic. Mage gameplay feels like a better Hogwarts Legacy and this is the best the mage class has felt in a Dragon Age game! I've played every single Dragon Age on Nightmare, but this one feels a lot easier. I don't feel like the game is well-balanced because there was an insane difficulty spike when I went on a mission to recruit one of the companions. After that mission it went back to being ridiculously easy again. It took me 4 hours before I felt like I needed to use a healing potion and it was 5 hours before I died for the first time. I don't know what to make of it so it goes here.

[h2] Conclusion: [/h2]
If you're a fan of previous Dragon Age games, I don't feel like this game is for you. In fact I'm really not sure who it's for and I struggle giving it a recommendation. Many people seem to like it but my friends who are Dragon Age fans share many of my opinions. I played BG3 for 20 hours straight on release without realising, I was having so much fun. I remember going to bed and I couldn't wit to wake up and play it again. I managed to play 11+ hours in The Veilguard, and I went to bed disappointed and today I don't feel like playing it right now. I usually wait until completion before I write my reviews but I couldn't with this one. I will try again later and If I change my mind about the game down the line, I'll change my review, but as it stands, I do not recommend Dragon Age: The Veilguard",im a massive dragon age fan and ive loved them all since origins even  but after  hours in the veilguard it saddens me to say that i cant help but feel disappointed i bought this game against my better judgement in spite of the controversies and in spite of the scathing reviews from skill up and mr matty plays because dragon age is my favourite gaming series my first  hours were incredible and i was so happy that the game wasnt just not terrible but actually good however after those frontloaded  hours the cracks started to show and those cracks quickly turned into a gaping chasm of mediocrity and i started to realise those two creators told several truths in their reviews i strongly recommend you check at least one of those out before you buy but after my first  hours these are my initial thoughts h the good h b

Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178322836,"[h2] Dragon Age: The Veilguard [/h2]

The problem with Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a game isn’t about the presence or absence of any particular agenda. It’s not even about the shift away from the dark fantasy tone of the first game, as the BioWare director pointed out, saying that fans of the first game are no longer the primary audience, and therefore their voices don’t really matter much (even though early reviews by journalists mentioned a “return of BioWare,” and the developers themselves said they wanted to go back to their roots and regain fans’ trust).

How they plan to achieve that while doing the exact opposite of what fans ask for is a mystery to me. The game has a lot of flaws: boring characters, spoiling the main Dragon Age: Inquisition twist within the first 40 minutes (which was one of the main reasons I preordered the game, even though I had low expectations for its quality - at least the plot was intriguing). Overall, the game has become almost childish, as if it’s now rated PEGI 12.

The characters are completely uninteresting and lack any depth. The dialogue is just terrible, and as an RPG, it plays poorly. If it weren’t part of this franchise, I’d say it’s below average.

I also want to point out the discrepancy between the user score and the metascore on Metacritic (critics rate the game highly while players are, as usual, angry). Furthermore, for me, the mostly positive reviews on Steam are also surprising. I read positive reviews, and they literally say the game is average or below average, yet they give it a thumbs up!

This installment feels like a cheap Marvel production to me. Despite the mixed reception of Inquisition and its own controversial aspects, next to Veilguard, it now seems like a masterpiece.

The optimization is worth noting, but most of the time, you’re running through narrow, corridor-like locations, and aside from the occasional reflections, the graphics don’t seem much better than they were ten years ago in the previous game.
The combat has become purely action-oriented, without any turn-based elements, which is a matter of taste, though overall the combat feels energetic. However, the enemy design (including the darkspawn) now looks downright cartoonish and cringeworthy.

I’m someone who, in my own way, enjoyed both the second and third games and love the first one, but I consider this one not just the weakest but an outright mistake. The game lacks soul, it’s not engaging, and it feels like Starfield but in a fantasy world (bland and gray, despite its bright colors in design).",h dragon age the veilguard h the problem with dragon age the veilguard as a game isnt about the presence or absence of any particular agenda its not even about the shift away from the dark fantasy tone of the first game as the bioware director pointed out saying that fans of the first game are no longer the primary audience and therefore their voices dont really matter much even though early reviews by journalists mentioned a return of bioware and the developers themselves said they wanted to go back to their roots and regain fans trust how they plan to achieve that while doing the exact opposite of what fans ask for is a mystery to me the game has a lot of flaws boring characters spoiling the main dragon age inquisition twist within the first  minutes which was one of the main reasons i preordered the game even though i had low expectations for its quality  at least the plot was intriguing overall the game has become almost childish as if its now rated pegi  the characters are completely uninteresting and lack any depth the dialogue is just terrible and as an rpg it plays poorly if it werent part of this franchise id say its below average i also want to point out the discrepancy between the user score and the metascore on metacritic critics rate the game highly while players are as usual angry furthermore for me the mostly positive reviews on steam are also surprising i read positive reviews and they literally say the game is average or below average yet they give it a thumbs up this installment feels like a cheap marvel production to me despite the mixed reception of inquisition and its own controversial aspects next to veilguard it now seems like a masterpiece the optimization is worth noting but most of the time youre running through narrow corridorlike locations and aside from the occasional reflections the graphics dont seem much better than they were ten years ago in the previous game the combat has become purely actionoriented without any turnbased elements which is a matter of taste though overall the combat feels energetic however the enemy design including the darkspawn now looks downright cartoonish and cringeworthy im someone who in my own way enjoyed both the second and third games and love the first one but i consider this one not just the weakest but an outright mistake the game lacks soul its not engaging and it feels like starfield but in a fantasy world bland and gray despite its bright colors in design,NEU,,

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178855866,"[h1]The current major flaws of Planet Coaster 2 (I still love it [/h1]
[b][u] The purpose of this review is to hope that future updates will truly listen to player feedback, restore those beloved core features, and optimize the experience to return Planet Coaster 2 to its original creativity and immersion. [/u] [/b]
[h2] Issue 1: Lack of Steam Workshop Integration [/h2]
Steam Workshop is one of the key features that makes this game stand out among simulation business games. The workshop feature of Planet Coaster 1 is very easy to use. However, the second generation abandoned Steam's workshop in favor of a self-built workshop system, which greatly reduced the experience. Network connections are often slow, resulting in a long time to load or download works. In addition, the process of subscribing to works is more complicated and not as convenient as the one-click subscription of Steam Workshop. What's even more unsatisfactory is that there are download restrictions on self-built workshops.
[h2] Issue 2: Misleading Multiplayer Mode [/h2]
The game was advertised as a multiplayer experience where players could collaborate to build their dream park. I even gifted a copy to a friend, looking forward to building a park together. Unfortunately, the reality is disappointing—""multiplayer mode"" simply means players take turns building, which doesn’t provide any real-time interaction and feels indistinguishable from single-player mode. [h3] To make matters worse, the developers have quietly removed the ""cross-platform multiplayer"" tag from the game without explanation. Rather than addressing why multiplayer functionality is lacking, the developers have simply avoided the issue, leaving players frustrated. [/h3]
[h2] Issue 3: Massive Content Reduction [/h2]
The original Planet Coaster offered a vast array of content with diverse themes and blueprints, making it easy for players to design varied and complex parks. In Planet Coaster 2, many classic themes like Fairytale, Western, and Pirate have been removed, leaving only limited Mythology and Viking themes. Without these beloved themes, players lack the range of scenery pieces they once had, and the number of available blueprints has been drastically cut. For players with limited time or design skills, these blueprints are essential for streamlining the building process. [h3]Unfortunately, the reduced content seems to pave the way for additional paid DLC, which feels like an attempt to ""nickel and dime"" the community.[/h3] The range of vegetation has also been significantly cut down to just four or five types of biomes, omitting classic desert or polar vegetation, which were previously included for free.
[h2] Issue 4: Restrictions in Sandbox Mode [/h2]
[h3] Career Parks Can’t Be Played in Sandbox Mode: [/h3]
[h3] Reduced Sandbox Map Size: [/h3] The sandbox maps in Planet Coaster 2 are noticeably smaller, about one-third the size of those in the original game. 
[h2] Issue 5: Missing Edge Scrolling Function [/h2]
In Planet Coaster, players could move around the map easily using edge scrolling, a simple yet highly convenient feature. However, this basic functionality has been removed in Planet Coaster 2, forcing players to rely on less efficient methods to adjust their view, which complicates navigation and diminishes the overall experience.
[h2] Issue 6: Inadequate Guest AI [/h2]
There are obvious problems with the path selection of tourists. They are still likely to concentrate in the same area, resulting in frequent congestion. Such problems not only affect the operating efficiency of the amusement park, but also cause tourists to be unable to enjoy the facilities in the congestion, such as being unable to find a restaurant or go to the toilet, which in turn causes various adverse reactions (such as vomiting). Even more disappointing is that the personality and type of tourists have also been cancelled, and the behavior of tourists appears to be monotonous and boring, lacking personalized interaction, affecting the sense of immersion.
[h2] Issue 7: Complex and Unintuitive UI Design [/h2]
The UI in Planet Coaster 2 is cluttered and unintuitive. Additionally, accessing submenus requires repeated clicks to locate specific items, and exiting these menus can also be cumbersome. While UI design should prioritize simplicity and ease of use, Planet Coaster 2 fails to meet these standards, resulting in a clunky user experience.
[h2] Issue 8: Missing Custom Audio, Video, and Image Import Features [/h2]
In Planet Coaster 1, players could import audio, video, and images from their computers, adding a personal touch to their parks. However, Planet Coaster 2 lacks this basic functionality, restricting players’ ability to personalize their parks and reducing the overall creative freedom.
[h2] Issue 9: Tedious Power and Water Repair Mechanic [/h2]
The most frustrating thing was that even if multiple technicians were hired, a generator could not be repaired quickly. Repeatedly clicking on the repair operation not only wasted time, but also affected the experience. If these events could be integrated into the plot or added more fun, they might be more popular with players.
[h2] Issue 10: Unrealistic Water Physics in the Waterpark [/h2]
Although Planet Coaster 2 emphasizes its waterpark theme, the water physics fail to deliver a realistic experience. For instance, the water behaves identically whether one or many people use the slides, ignoring the realistic differences in water reaction between light and heavy users. This uniform animation feels outdated and unconvincing, especially for a modern game.
[h2] Issue 11: Issues with Coaster Building [/h2]
The coaster-building experience in Planet Coaster 2 is less refined than in the original game, with several minor but frustrating issues. 
[h2] Issue 12: Weak Tutorial Experience [/h2]
[b]Planet Zoo I still remember how Nancy, a keeper, helped me from a novice to a qualified zoo manager. This process can be said to be very interesting. [/b]However, the tutorial of the second generation of RollerCoaster is boring and the prologue content is unattractive. 
[h2] Issue 13: Ineffective Weather System [/h2]
The weather system in Planet Coaster 2 is purely visual, with no meaningful impact on gameplay. Guests continue eating ice cream in the rain without umbrellas, which feels unrealistic. The game would benefit from more interactive weather effects, such as guests reacting to rain or seeking shelter. For a 2024 game, these interactions should be achievable, and their absence diminishes the sense of realism.
[h2] Issue 14: Difficult Staff Zoning with Persistent Bugs [/h2]
The employee zoning is very cumbersome and requires repeated adjustments during operation. However, even after the zoning is completed, employees are still not active in their work. Even if the task is nearby, employees will complain that there is nothing to do. This design is frustrating. In addition, the employee work area division system is not as convenient as the design of Planet Zoo. Even if the zoning is carefully set, employees still find it difficult to cooperate, which affects the management effect of the amusement park.
[h2] Issue 15: Reduced Management Content [/h2]
Many core management items have been removed in Planet Coaster 2, including vending machines, popcorn stands, hotels, restaurants, advertising boards, ATMs, security systems, and CCTV. These elements were key to the park management experience in previous games. Their removal leaves the park feeling incomplete and leads players to question whether these essential items will return as paid DLC. Even small features like customizing drink ingredients (e.g., adding ice) are missing, and fireworks have been completely omitted.

Build a dedicated water park with highly themed plummets of doom or add a relaxing lazy river to your theme parks for guests to chill in before their next coaster, the choice is yours. 

Would love to see guests using the inflatables more often and hope to see side activities like and hot tubs and splash pads in the future.

[u]Scaling[/u]
I cannot understate how much of a game changer the scaling tool is. I have used it in every build I have done so far. Every non-grid piece, including foliage, is now scaleable allowing you to easily create huge variety just using a single piece, just hit the C key and resize away. Most items can go between half and double their default size so you can use a giant inflatable to welcome guests into the park and then have smaller versions of that crab to keep guests company on their sun loungers. 

I gather items have size limits due to textures and models looking distorted if scaled too much, but I say give us an option in the menu to disable scaling constraints, I can live with a pixelated texture if it means I can create the crab gift shop of my dreams!

[u]Custom Themed Rides[/u]
Another feature I was blown away by was the ability to stick scenery pieces to any coaster car and any flat ride. In the original game the rides were highly themed and, while gorgeous, you couldn't really use the ""Afternoon Tea"" themed Teacups in your dragon's lair themed area of the park. Now though you can theme that ride however you like and the pieces will animate along with the ride seamlessly. Tools like mirroring and duplicating make theming a breeze and there are already

Currently you can't add scenery to tracked rides (trains, boats etc) so I'd like to see this added. 

[u]Moving Platforms[/u]
Something I have seen hardly anyone talking about is the addition of moving platform scenery pieces. These three pieces sitting quietly in your scenery tab give you the ability to turn any object into an animatronic... which is HUGE! There is a spinning, rising and side to side version of the platform all triggerable and all with different animation options. Stick your scenery pieces to the platforms and boom, you have an animated piece. Combine these with flat rides and coaster cars for some truly unique creations.

[h1]Under Construction[/h1]

[u]Paths[/u]
The new path system is revolutionary. Draw out huge plazas, place rides and shops directly onto the path, edit existing paths, all of these are great additions, I couldn't imagine going back to the old system from PlanCo1. I do think the path system could still do with some work though, there are some oversights/limitations that I'd love to see addressed:

- The Stamp tool isn't available for queues
- The brush doesn't always snap to existing paths 
- You can't change a path from staff to regular to natural, you have to delete and redo it (even though the natural paths are listed along with regular paths)

[u]The UI Sucks[/u]
All of the feedback about the UI being poor is warranted. The buttons sound great when you click them and the icons have all been redesigned and updated to fit the new graphical style, but the menus are a complete chore to click through.

- The Browser (main menu bar) is sometimes not visible, this should ALWAYS be visible and clickable across the bottom of the screen
- The pop out menus (pools, coasters etc) all require scrolling when there is plenty of room on the screen for the box to be bigger
- ""Construction Mode"" and ""Edit Mode"" for coasters and slides are separate for no reason at all
- Dropdown menus have been replaced with carousel menus (click left and right to switch between options but can only see one at a time), any option where you show less info to a user is worse in my book. Pools have 4 depths and I'm constantly clicking the wrong arrow and having to go around all the depths to find the one I want
- When holding C to scale, moving the mouse Up/Right is decrease size and Down/Left is increase size. Surely Up/Right are more associated with ""bigger"". The slider on the menu is configured to have Left be smaller and Right be bigger so it's not even consistent in game.
- When setting prices for items in shops every item opens in it's own separate screen
- You have to click confirm after you select a colour.
- You can't see the colour properly as the selected piece is highlighted blue.
- You have to click ""done"" twice to exit a scenery group (once to exit the item once to exit the group).
- You can't select a grid before you place a piece.
- If you copy a piece while inside a group, and exit the group, you loose the piece (in PC1 the piece would remain selected for you to place down)
- The multi select tool requires you to confirm a selection
- The multi select when in a scenery group doesn't support additive and subtractive selections but the tool outside of this does

[b]Despite the above though the game is so good that it's barely bothered me at all. The good outweighs the bad in every sense and I trust Frontier's track record in supporting their games.[/b]

Just in case anyone from Frontier is reading...

[u]Parades[/u]
This game is begging for parades! The ability to add scenery to coasters, rides and platforms is the perfect recipe for a parade system. Imagine you place a track with a start and end point, the cars are just empty platforms you can theme up, and guests gather as the cars go by... boom parade achieved! Let us trigger the parade at certain times and add entertainers to the cars to wave at the guests and we can achieve our most Disneyish dreams.

[u]Photographs[/u]
The best part about exiting a ride is stopping at the photo booth and laughing at your terrified face as you went over the big drop. I would be delighted to see guests come off of rides and check out their on ride photos, I'm imagining a shop called ""Happy Snaps"" with an alligator mascot (think Gulpee with a camera), guests who have been on rides with photos enabled can stop at this shop and buy photo prints, keyrings and mugs as souvenirs. Throw in some roving photographer staff (the Diver character Sandy Reef already has a camera) and static photo spots (combined with character spots maybe?) and you've got some charming gameplay that also feeds into park management and income.

[u]Weather Effects[/u]
Having weather in the game is great, I love seeing guests open umbrellas (RCT2 vibes) and love that sunburn is something you have to watch out for. I think it would be great for the weather to impact rides, some coasters should close during rain/lightning or high wind speeds. Guests could prefer covered rides during rain. Having this as toggleable option is a must though as it could get annoying in Sandbox mode.

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178568041,"Overall there is so much potential but you missed the mark big time. The coaster builder is amazing but everything else should be reconsidered. PC1 felt intuitive and clean but PC2 feels clunky and overly complicated. Why does selecting a coaster type have to take up the entire screen? Why did you remove all of the options for the mouse controls for desktop? What on earth is the point of the edit and construction mode? Why can't we see the testing results and keep constructing? Does the edit/construction menu have to be so huge yet still you have to flip through to do stuff? Why remove the ability to individually control friction on each coaster or change the train types? These are just a few examples. I think all anyone really wanted was PC1 but with MORE features and a better coaster builder/smooth ride experience. What we paid for is a gutted version of PC1 that is harder to navigate and looks outdated already. The sharp and crisp menus of PC1 that actually offered useful and enjoyable features, has been replaced with large and bubbly buttons that do half as much and take up twice the space. Again, the coaster builder is amazing and super impressive but focus should be put on the UI and not fixing what wasn't broken.",overall there is so much potential but you missed the mark big time the coaster builder is amazing but everything else should be reconsidered pc felt intuitive and clean but pc feels clunky and overly complicated why does selecting a coaster type have to take up the entire screen why did you remove all of the options for the mouse controls for desktop what on earth is the point of the edit and construction mode why cant we see the testing results and keep constructing does the editconstruction menu have to be so huge yet still you have to flip through to do stuff why remove the ability to individually control friction on each coaster or change the train types these are just a few examples i think all anyone really wanted was pc but with more features and a better coaster buildersmooth ride experience what we paid for is a gutted version of pc that is harder to navigate and looks outdated already the sharp and crisp menus of pc that actually offered useful and enjoyable features has been replaced with large and bubbly buttons that do half as much and take up twice the space again the coaster builder is amazing and super impressive but focus should be put on the ui and not fixing what wasnt broken,NEG,['AA'],AA

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178639992,"EDIT 1: I'd like to add one negative I forgot to mention in my initial review! The pathfinding on the park guests is pretty awful. If you have scenery on your paths, chances are they won't make any attempt to avoid it. They also tend to crowd and walk in a straight line to whatever they're most interested in, rather than spreading out.

After watching nearly all of the official PC2 content ahead of release, it's safe to say I was extremely excited to try it out! Then, the game releases, and I see it has mixed reviews. Clunky UI, unreasonable guest cap, crashes, blurry visuals, etc. All of this had me extremely worried since PC1 is fantastic and this game adds everything I wanted from a sequel. However, I'm happy to say that while these critiques are valid and deserve to be discussed, my experience with the game so far has been amazing. I'll go over a few points and provide my pros, cons and wishes for each one!

Graphics: 

PC2 looks fantastic. Vibrant colors, nice global illumination and reflections, fantastic animations and effects, it's definitely an improvement over PC1. And they finally made lighting work properly inside of buildings so that you can have REAL dark rides which is fantastic, I can't wait to mess with that. I always felt that PC1 looked a little ""murky"" if that makes sense, but I don't get that from this game. I don't really have any cons or wishes as of yet graphics-wise. There is the complaint that visuals are blurry, but you can fix that by turning off motion blur and depth of field (which was patched in the latest hotfix by making the game turn these settings off by default for new players).

UI:

This is the big one. I thought it was going to be genuinely awful based on how people were describing it, but I personally had no major issues? I could see why the coaster select screen would be a pain though as it is a lot of buttons, and I would like a way to duplicate colors from other objects without the use of hex codes (or even better, create custom pallets). Aside from this, the UI does lag when you're loading in new tabs. However, other than that, my experience with it has been mostly smooth. I'm completely against dumbing-down a PC release for the sake of console parity which is why the UI isn't as good as it could've been, but I don't think it ruins the gameplay at all.

Building:

Probably my favorite part of the sequel! I would always get OCD with PC1 when trying to perfectly center a gridless piece, but the new snap distance feature really helps remedy that. It's still not absolutely perfect, I did find myself having to use some weird techniques at some point like I would in PC1, but it's an extremely useful tool overall. And then you have the ability to attach scenery pieces to coasters and rides which is an absolute game changer. So many new creative possibilities when paired with the equally amazing scaling tool as well as improved color control and patterns. Another major complaint was the lack of the PC1 themes. I can see why people miss them but... isn't the point of a sequel to provide new stuff on top of the base mechanics of the original? All of the new themes are fantastic, and I wouldn't be surprised if they brought some of the old PC1 themes back in the future.

Pools/Flumes:

I'm so happy they brought these back from RCT3. When I first got PC1 I was actually extremely disappointed that it didn't have them (at the time I didn't read much into games before buying them so it was a surprise to me). I haven't gotten to mess with the flumes yet so I can't speak on the physics issues, it's nice to know that Frontier is working on fixing them though (not that it's an excuse for releasing them in a poor state in the first place, there's too much of that in the gaming industry already). The pools, however, are great. I love how the water looks, building them is really satisfying, and there are plenty of depth options for variation. I've been playing on sandbox so I won't be speaking on the management aspect of them. I also haven't gotten to use the wave machine or lazy river features yet which I'm very excited about. I do wish there were more pool extras though, hopefully we see a lot more in the future.

Rollercoasters/Rides:

The rollercoaster building system is fantastic as usual. Now, there are even more pieces to mess with such as drop and switch tracks. I don't have much to say about it, but I do love what's been added. Rides as well, customization is fantastic and there are plenty of great ones already in the game.

Management:

I mentioned previously that I've been playing in sandbox so I haven't really experienced the management. If I mess around with it at any point I might update my review!

Path System:

It's everything. Takes some learning, but once you know what you're doing with it, the possibilities are endless. I agree with the complaint that there needs to be stamps for queue paths, though. My plazas have never looked crispier than they have with these tools. Pools use the same system as well so there's a plethora of creative opportunities.

Extras:

Hate day one DLC. An extra $24.79 (CAD,) for 10 rides? Players who are unable to get the deluxe edition or upgrade to the DLC will feel left out even though it's not a massive amount of content. If they wanted extra money to (presumably,) support the promotional campaign ahead of the game's release, maybe they could've done a special physical edition, but locking 10 rides behind an overpriced DLC is disappointing to see from Frontier. The guest cap is definitely ridiculous, that literally could've just been made a setting, but it is going to be fixed soon which is nice. Hopefully this serves as a lesson to Frontier that PC and console should stay completely separate instead of being molten together to suit parity. The same goes for the Frontier workshop. I'm not too picky on the GB limit, but the Steam workshop should've at least been an option as well. People are used to it and like it. Aside from these bigger issues, I did have one crash randomly while building (I think I had been playing for about 14 hours at the time), but the autosave was automatically set to 3 minutes so I didn't lose much.

Final Thoughts:

Overall, I'm absolutely loving Planet Coaster 2. I think it's a massive improvement over the first game in nearly every way. While the critiques are valid, I don't personally think that any of them ruin the gameplay and Frontier is already working on fixes for most of them. Do I think the game deserves a mixed rating? Kind of. I think it would've been better off with a mostly positive. On one hand, it sends a message to Frontier that these are issues which need to be fixed. On the other hand, it may turn off a lot of players who wouldn't otherwise be bothered by some of these issues. I hope that the reviews go up once the game is updated a bit more as I genuinely think it's worthy of the time of anyone who enjoyed the original. I'd give PC2 a 9/10, it has an incredibly strong base that could be close to perfection with a little polish! Give the game a go if you've been waiting for it, I'm having an amazing time.",edit  id like to add one negative i forgot to mention in my initial review the pathfinding on the park guests is pretty

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178568109,"This is tough for me to write. I LOVED Planet Coaster, I know it was not the perfect game but the foundation they had was incredible. For this to be the sequel I feel somewhat let down, Frontier have released an unfinished game.

- The UI is horrendous to work with, this game has been built for consoles.
- 6,000 guest cap? Again, this has been implemented for consoles, why have the not put a simple check box for unlimited?
- No night
- No hotels
- No security

From a foundation point of view, the game has gone backwards from it's predecessor.

I am hoping to change this review in the near future but currently, I am unimpressed.

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178510360,"Wanted to love it, but can't. There are significant improvements and new features from Planet Coaster 1. But there are significant oversights, issues, and omissions too.

Waterslide physics are tragic. Riders and tubes go over hills at any speed like they have rollercoaster upstops. 'Open' special features like bowls, halfpipes, and such have invisible tracks for tubes to follow. Tubes suddenly come to a complete stop and make a 90 degree turn because that's what the invisible walls make them do. Tubes get stuck on an open halfpipe because they didn't get high enough to follow the hidden track to make it to the exit of the section. Tubes smack off edges of curved slide walls several feet before touching them. Sliders snap suddenly to a preset height on corners whether they're going slow or fast. Every rider and tube go down in an exactly identical way. 

Repeated textures are terrible. Every 10m of grass has the exact same pattern. Coloured patches repeat dozens of times across a single face of a rock. Every fifth tile on the path has the exact same dark spot.

Can't currently recommend, suggest you get it later when it's on sale or they've fixed some of the issues. Please Frontier fix the water slides. At least make them as good as the ones in Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, a game that's now 20 years old.



- Editied at 5.5 hrs playtime -

Even worse, discovered that on several special slide segments, rafts and tubes clip way through the walls of the slides. It is almost hilariously bad, that they locked rafts and tubes down to forced to following a hidden path, and didn't even check if that path clipped them through the slide.

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178516120,"First of all, I must admit that the game looks better than PC1 The graphics and the lighting are incredible. The game have some good new features (pathing system, energy / water system, water parks) that makes it interesting for the people who never played PC1.

For the fans of PC1, it looks like the game is not finished (it lacks some BASIC features / object / facilities).  
The UI is just HORRIBLE and just counter-intuitive (way too many clicks). 
The game was clearly designed for consoles (anyone who are denying it are clearly lying to themselves as it is that obvious, it's as plain as the nose on your face)

The Frontier Workshop looks horrible and it is limited. The Steam Workshop was very good

To sum up : It is disappointing for PC1 players (on computers) because we made the success of PC1 and we are treated badly by Frontier. This version should have been the ""Beta testing version"" 6 months prior to the launch so they can correct what was wrong and have our feedback. Remember, players were really involved in the process of making PC1 (Alpha testing and Beta testing). For PC2, the players were left out of the process.

The game is more than just a DLC that could have been for PC1 but in the same time it's not a complete new version of the game either. 

I still have faith in Frontier because they proved in the past that they can listen to the players but we will have to wait at least  6-12 months to have a proper Planet Coaster 2. (And In my opinion to reach that goal, they should separate the console version and the PC version)

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178660074,"Planet Coaster can be used to make a lot of different kinds of parks, and it facilitates many different styles of play,  So I can't say everyone will have the same experience as me, but I'm really enjoying this game.

At first I was super annoyed at the pathing tools, and the fact my rides were always breaking down even though i had a ton of idle mechanics.  But once i figured out that I could make hybrid spline+grid based paths that merged cleanly by using a combination of the path stamping tool and splines with the straight and curved  settings I was really happy.  Paths can still be fiddly but I also feel like I have more control over the layout now.  And making switchbacked queue pathing is a dream.

It still feels like mechanics do a really bad job of finding work on their own, but I mostly solved that issue by creating work zones, assigning mechanics to a zone and changing their schedule to work that zone all day.  I think a lot of negative feeling on this subject is that the condition system seems to work differently from PC1.  In PC1 breakdowns were a roll of the dice, with higher probabilities if the condition was low.  But in PC2 it appears breadowns only occur once the condition reaches zero and mechanics just need to service the ride before the service timer expires (which seems to be around a 1 or 2 hour game-time interval) to prevent the condition from decreasing.

One issue that I still have is that guests tend to walk to rides they want to go on then turn around and leave for seemingly no reason.  After some fiddling I discovered that the ride price was too high (despite setting the price to 'bargain').  Folks were walking up, deciding it was too expensive and leaving.  But there was no feedback, no thought bubble saying 'ride x is too much money' or the like.  So the system may be working as intended, but the feedback to the player could use a pass.

I've seen some funny stuff as well.  After several hours of downpour all my guests were heading to the gates.  On a whim I slapped down a Body Dryer and literally every single guest was drawn to that one point in the park in order to get dry.  Was also amusing to see all the trash they dropped in that one corner of the park.

On the visuals front this game is GORGEOUS.  The light filtering through the tree branches is really nice, and adding lights to your coasters at night is something to behold.  I'm running in 4k on a 4070Ti with max settings and DLSS balanced.  Not quite hitting solid 60 but likely close.  I'd kill for VR support, even if it was only for walking around the park and riding the rides.

Lastly, one other reviewer stated there was no random rotation of objects.  This is not true.  Not only is there random rotation but random scaling (and more!)  the trick is that you just need to make a scenery brush, add some scenery to the brush, enable the random rotation settings and set the min/max scale and now you can paint with trees.  I spent a good 30 minutes dialing in the perfect Black Spruce forest brush and now my viking village is looking fantastic.  Hundreds if not thousands of trees placed with no more than a click and drag.  Honestly, the new scenery brush is fantastic (its the small tree button in the lower right corner if you missed it).

Anyway, I'm having a great time with PC2.  Its got a few rough edges right now for sure, but I suspect they'll be knocked off with a few patches and hotfixes.",planet coaster can be used to make a lot of different kinds of parks and it facilitates many different styles of play so i cant say everyone will have the same experience as me but im really enjoying this game at first i was super annoyed at the pathing tools and the fact my rides were always breaking down even though i had a ton of idle mechanics but once i figured out that i could make hybrid splinegrid based paths that merged cleanly by using a combination of the path stamping tool and splines with the straight and curved settings i was really happy paths can still be fiddly but i also feel like i have more control over the layout now and making switchbacked queue pathing is a dream it still feels like mechanics do a really bad job of finding work on their own but i mostly solved that issue by creating work zones assigning mechanics to a zone and changing their schedule to work that zone all day i think a lot of negative feeling on this subject is that the condition system seems to work differently from pc in pc breakdowns were a roll of the dice with higher probabilities if the condition was low but in pc it appears breadowns only occur once the condition reaches zero and mechanics just need to service the ride before the service timer expires which seems to be around a  or  hour gametime interval to prevent the condition from decreasing one issue that i still have is that guests tend to walk to rides they want to go on then turn around and leave for seemingly no reason after some fiddling i discovered that the ride price was too high despite setting the price to bargain folks were walking up deciding it was too expensive and leaving but there was no feedback no thought bubble saying ride x is too much money or the like so the system may be working as intended but the feedback to the player could use a pass ive seen some funny stuff as well after several hours of downpour all my guests were heading to the gates on a whim i slapped down a body dryer and literally every single guest was drawn to that one point in the park in order to get dry was also amusing to see all the trash they dropped in that one corner of the park on the visuals front this game is gorgeous the light filtering through the tree branches is really nice and adding lights to your coasters at night is something to behold im running in k on a ti with max settings and dlss balanced not quite hitting solid  but likely close id kill for vr support even if it was only for walking around the park and riding the rides lastly one other reviewer stated there was no random rotation of objects this is not true not only is there random rotation but random scaling and more the trick is that you just need to make a scenery brush add some scenery to the brush enable the random rotation settings and set the minmax scale and now you can paint with trees i spent a good  minutes dialing in the perfect black spruce forest brush and now my viking village is looking fantastic hundreds if not thousands of trees placed with no more than a click and drag honestly the new scenery brush is fantastic its the small tree button in the lower right corner if you missed it anyway im having a great time with pc its got a few rough edges right now for sure but i suspect theyll be knocked off with a few patches and hotfixes,POS,['AA'],AA
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178608231,"After 10 hours of playing Planet Coaster 2, I have a lot of questions and disappointments. There are so many features missing that I loved from Planet Zoo and the original Planet Coaster. It’s surprising that with all the technology and features they already had, they didn’t use them here.

Currently, there are quite a few bugs that make the experience frustrating. The new path system behaves unpredictably and is difficult to make look clean and organized. Even the waterparks from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 feel superior to what’s offered here; there’s practically no physics applied to water slides, which is really disappointing. Also, there’s no option for random rotation when placing items like rocks and trees, making landscaping feel repetitive.

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178703404,"I do not recommend the game in its current state. There are many issues such as guests being stuck, not queuing properly or not visiting certain areas of a pool. It feels like the game has not been properly tested before release. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the next couple of weeks.

I'm happy to see many features that were present in Planet Zoo, and there are some new cool features such as scenery scaling, scenery distance snapping and the scenery brush.

One major feature that I'm really missing is proper multiplayer. This was shortly advertised, but other COOP than sharing a save file is not present.'

Positives:
- Scenery scaling and distance snapping
- Scenery brush
- More pathing tools
- Lighting
- Moving platforms are nice to have
- Switch tracks and turntables enable layouts that were impossible in PC1
- Pools and slides are a nice addition, but need more work to be enjoyable

Negatives:
- Steam workshop is far superior and should be available for PC players
- Frontier workshop is very limited and requires a Frontier account to work
- UI/UX does not work well for mouse and keyboard (for example selector tool)
- Terrain stamps (like in Planet Zoo) are missing
- Water has no physics; the flumes/slides are just a preset smooth animation as if there are rails
- Guests in the water are all moving with the same animation which looks really out of place
- Pools are boring and need more content
- Guest path finding is very basic. They will go through any objects placed on paths and pools. A better approach would have been to use the animal pathfinding system from Planet Zoo.
- Barriers and kerbs don't block guest path finding
- Research tree is a nice concept, but the content is too basic. More stuff should be locked behind research.
- Why is the minimal path width still 4m? With the new tools we can draw much smaller paths, but placing them via the other tools would be much better.
- No custom music or billboards on launch (should be added soon?)

The Evil Within,268050,178636132,"Just dropping, S Tier Horror Survival that still holds after 10 years, what an amazing game. 

This game will always stay close to my heart, the last I played it was probably 8 years ago and it has been lying in my steam profile for ages but I never bothered to play it, After finishing The Evil Within 2 I was in hopes of The Evil Within 3 but that never happened and never will happen (Thank you Microsoft). 

With all the horror survival buzz thanks to Silent Hill 2 I didn't want to get that game at the moment but really felt like diving back into this one and man what a fantastic game.

I think this game got a bad rep when it released because of poor optimization and that really dragged it when it came to its performance on console and PC's back in the day but now it runs flawlessly even at higher fps and that just makes it way more fun. 

True horror survival, although linear, it's difficult, rewarding and A LOT of fun, MUST recommend, this is coming from someone who owns and has played ALL of the Resident Evil games. 

Thank you Shinji Mikami, you truly are the father of horror survival games, your formula has made so many studios successful in the last 10 years, even when you were not working on the Resident Evil games anymore you gave them the template from Resident Evil 4 and the remake has been huge, I know there were others who made the game too and their efforts are appreciated.",just dropping s tier horror survival that still holds after  years what an amazing game this game will always stay close to my heart the last i played it was probably  years ago and it has been lying in my steam profile for ages but i never bothered to play it after finishing the evil within  i was in hopes of the evil within  but that never happened and never will happen thank you microsoft with all the horror survival buzz thanks to silent hill  i didnt want to get that game at the moment but really felt like diving back into this one and man what a fantastic game i think this game got a bad rep when it released because of poor optimization and that really dragged it when it came to its performance on console and pcs back in the day but now it runs flawlessly even at higher fps and that just makes it way more fun true horror survival although linear its difficult rewarding and a lot of fun must recommend this is coming from someone who owns and has played all of the resident evil games thank you shinji mikami you truly are the father of horror survival games your formula has made so many studios successful in the last  years even when you were not working on the resident evil games anymore you gave them the template from resident evil  and the remake has been huge i know there were others who made the game too and their efforts are appreciated,NEG,['Indie'],Indie

This game was clearly trying to be Resident Evil 4, with absolutely no ammo. The whole, low ammo aspect that is supposed to make the player anxious, just pisses me off. I have to make every single god damned shot count.

Lost Ark,1599340,178558592,"tl;dr: AGS as a publisher and the KR MMORPG grindy game doesn't respect your time. Play something else.

Lost Ark's best part is the challenging but fun raids. Some of them do requires you to respect patterns and adjust your movements + skill rotations around them.
Everything of the game is pretty much fubar. If you don't have decent active guild with players that played latest raids, you can find yourself in lobby waiting room simulation from time to time. Horizontal progressions take bloody amount of time.
Classic KR mmorpg have super grindy progressions that waste your time such as Elixirs/Transcendence clicking. Even with AI/calculators, it can still takes up hours to do them, with pure RNG.

3 weeks ago I got a temp ban because I exploited a simple Stronghold visiting trick that AGS/SG should've disabled easily in the first place. 1 month of temp ban would already put me behind the raiding curve for months. This is because I mainly played 1 character (my highest char is ilvl 1660), second highest at 1640, rest alts at 1620.
On 5th November, AGS found out their scripts didn't remove items properly on 2 weeks banned players that exploited the bug. Many of original 1 month banned players like me extended into perma-bans. REMINDER that AGS could've done rollbacks instead of this roundabout temp bans. 

The 7 sets of boxes I opened temporarily didn't even worth much, I used most of them on quality tapping. I told customer support to reconsider my perma-ban duration. But instead I received an automated bot message at 10:57 am after I typed up my appeal. (Basically no real life person actually looked into my appeal at all).

Founder buyer with 8.6k playtime, never chaos dungeon botted, never RMT'ed, never bussed in raids.

Lost Ark,1599340,176998910,"The game felt actually fun in the beginning during Valtan-Akkan days. There were definitely issues despite this though, but it was way more bearable then the current state of Lost Ark. Lost Ark right now has some of the worst systems in mmos that I have ever experienced. Elixirs and Transcendence hold back the game to such a large degree, that it suck outs the fun, making me feel like not even wasting my time to play. These terrible progression systems on top of the awful gatekeeping that is present within the game really just makes the game feel like such a massive waste of time despite the combat being super enjoyable. 

I really do strongly believe that Ignite servers are a step in the right direction compared to most of these progression events that have been around for awhile. Ignite servers feel like how the game should be played for the Western version. However, despite this, the awful progression systems hold back this shining light of potential. They give a free 40 set of elixirs for playing on ignite servers, but the free 40 set is the luck set bonus (when you're dps you want critical or master set bonus, and for support you wants faith, luminary or advance). So you still need to cut at least your helmet and gloves, which isn't nearly as bad as current live servers starting from scratch, but it is still pretty bad because.. well the systems just suck so bad. Not only is it just awful rng but it is time consuming from actually playing the game. 

Honestly, solo raids are awesome, but it only goes up to ivory tower, and they nerfed the gold from Akkan solo recently (when it is bound gold which is absolutely harmless). I dunno why they continue to go down this path of speaking for mokokos (new players) and advertising for them, yet making the game super hostile to new & returning players.

The good:

- it is a fun game with well made dungeons and bosses.
- badass villains and heroes and some well made cutscenes.
- a very well made soudntrack. Seriously, the Brelshaza's Phantom Alstagia boss song brings me a tear to my eyes everytime I listen to it.
- fluid and nice skill moves.
- a nice enough story. It's a cliche of good vs evil, but it's nice enough.
- a good amount of content to those aiming at collectibles.
- the skills of the characters are in general well made allowing nice combos and moves that generates the thrill of playing a Action RPG.
- the skins for characters are quite well made, and it's possible to farm those in game, without the need to put real money on the table.
- events in-game from time to time to level up a character, because leveling a character from scratch is a pain.

The bad:

- RNG on EVERY SINGLE PROGRESSION SYSTEM. Seriously, whoever design this has a serious gambling problem.
- a toxic player base that resembles a VX gas canister. *sigh* I mean it, they are like brats playing League of Legends and is one of the WORST aspects of this game.
- the game is made on Unreal Engine 3 and despite running well on most modern PCs, there's some tweaking with configs to achieve a good performance.
- game suffers from time to time from disconnects, mainly because of the anti-cheat system and the game takes ages to boot even on a SSD drive.
- on the topic about disconnects: got dced on the last minutes of a raid? Pray that you can log back in time, otherwise, the game will count it as ""complete"" but you don't get any reward. No Gold, no EXP, no Mats, no nothing. :(
- there are many other aspects that I found bad, but it'll make this review too long and there's plenty of those here on Steam already, so... yeah.

Diablo IV,2344520,177216783,"I have been playing Diablo Games for nearly 30 years. I cannot recommend this game at full retail price.
Is Diablo 4 good? Yes, as a generic ARPG. Buy this game AND expansion ( if you can call it that) on sale at a discount.

Does Vessel of Hatred make it better? Marginally, by making the game feel like a clone of Diablo 3 (for better or worse.)

Rune words feel lazy. Mix any two stones and get their prefix and suffix. No unique builds akin to the D2 LOD system.

The Spirit born is just a D3 Monk with Druid vibes minus the auras and plays like the Blood Knight from Diablo Immortal. It wouldn't surprise me if it was a copy paste job done to save time. 

Paladins ARE put in game! JUST LIKE WE WANTED! As non playable, chumpy characters. It even seems like they fleshed out the skills for a Crusader / Paladin just to give them to a Mercenary.  

Lorath is on vacation, the whole game. Said to be looking for Nayrelle ends up meaning WHO THE HECK KNOWS, BUT HE LEFT YOU A LETTER!

The base world and story telling do not fit the theme of Diablo. Too much emphasis is put on friendship, trust and feel good moments. This is a direct contrast of the GRIM DARK feeling they were going fr in this game. All for the story itself to never be finished and told to completion. 
Even after the expansion, no new end game boss, no fighting prime evils. No conclusion!

The fact that Blizzard would sell us an unfinished Expansion for the price of a fully loaded base game is beyond me. 
This game should more accurately be titled INTRO TO the Vessel of Hatred seeing as there is no new end game boss, the story is lacks conclusion and feels like a seasonal update not an expansion DLC, and the new monsters are just reskins of existing enemies. Flayers are a rare enemy encounter and underutilized. 
The Real Money Store works great though and you can be rest assured there are plenty of 20 dollar skins for you to spend money on.

Diablo IV,2344520,177852479,"I wish I could like this game. I absolutely adored Diablo 1 when it came out and spent waaaay too much time after work playing it. D4 has all the right ingredients, excellent voice acting, lovely graphics, good environmental effects (wind, rain, ash, etc) interesting dungeons and ruins, but the endless fetch quests really soured me on the game. 

Everything is a fetch quest. Every little side quest is the same, ""go get this, or do this and I'll give you this."" It's boring and really sucks the fun out of the game. The main story is little better, always one step behind the main bad guy (or girl, in this specific case) or their minions, and only if you go explore this one new area, you might find them, otherwise...more fetch quests!

So, it's repetitive, and that's a negative for me. Also, some classes are stupidly overpowered. My main character is a Necromancer which I thought would be fun to play. I was wrong, One of the first skills you get is the ability to summon skeleton archers. At my current level as of this writing, 33, I have 4 archers and 3 with scythes, and I rarely have to interact with any of the enemies as the software detection is so good, my army is attacking the enemies before they even get on the screen for me to see them. So all I have to do is wander around and pick up loot and occasionally throw a spell at a boss-level bad guy. It's very dull, made worse by my skeleton army auto-respawning on the rare occasions that they are killed in action.

TEKKEN 8,1778820,175362006,"Game's a 50/50 button masher by design. Players are 2 buttons away from dealing 80% of your life with Rage Art or Heat Smash.

TEKKEN 8,1778820,173335493,"Tekken 8, while undeniably more accessible than its predecessors, has stripped away much of the tactical depth that defined the series. The game feels like it's been simplified to cater to a larger player base, but at the cost of what made Tekken unique. What we're left with is a game that's largely about 50/50 situations, with little room for the nuanced, defensive play that even 2D fighting games manage to preserve.

One of the biggest disappointments for me is how defense is not only unrewarded but outright punished, particularly with the introduction of chip damage. In other fighting games, there are defensive tools to counterbalance aggressive play, but in Tekken 8, it feels like the game is designed to reward the player who can memorize the best combos and apply pressure non-stop. The Ranked matches exacerbate this issue, becoming a toxic experience where opponents either quit after one match, have unbearable lag, or exhibit other frustrating behaviors.

After over 100 hours of trying to give this game a chance, I've lost the drive to continue. I might revisit it if Kunimitsu is reintroduced, but for now, Tekken 8 is getting uninstalled. I'm finding more satisfaction in games like Guilty Gear Strive or Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, where my efforts in practicing hit confirms are actually rewarded, unlike in Tekken 8, where any attempt at analysis seems to get me punished anyway.

The final straw for me is the Battle Pass system, which feels even more intrusive and unpleasant in Tekken 8 than in Rising. It's a feature I genuinely dislike and it only adds to my overall disappointment with the game.",tekken  while undeniably more accessible than its predecessors has stripped away much of the tactical depth that defined the series the game feels like its been simplified to cater to a larger player base but at the cost of what made tekken unique what were left with is a game thats largely about  situations with little room for the nuanced defensive play that even d fighting games manage to preserve one of the biggest disappointments for me is how defense is not only unrewarded but outright punished particularly with the introduction of chip damage in other fighting games there are defensive tools to counterbalance aggressive play but in tekken  it feels like the game is designed to reward the player who can memorize the best combos and apply pressure nonstop the ranked matches exacerbate this issue becoming a toxic experience where opponents either quit after one match have unbearable lag or exhibit other frustrating behaviors after over  hours of trying to give this game a chance ive lost the drive to continue i might revisit it if kunimitsu is reintroduced but for now tekken  is getting uninstalled im finding more satisfaction in games like guilty gear strive or granblue fantasy versus rising where my efforts in practicing hit confirms are actually rewarded unlike in tekken  where any attempt at analysis seems to get me punished anyway the final straw for me is the battle pass system which feels even more intrusive and unpleasant in tekken  than in rising its a feature i genuinely dislike and it only adds to my overall disappointment with the game,NEU,"['Unknown', 'Indie']",Multiple

TEKKEN 8,1778820,176364038,"Probably the easiest and most aggressive entry in the series, Tekken 8 has solid features but is marred by scummy monetization policies. It feels like I'm playing a free-to-play, gacha game anytime there is a new update. Miss the latest DLC character? The main menu will remind you constantly of their presence, with the in-game store taking priority over the ""real"" menu, forcing you to navigate around it. This is unfortunate in a cheaper game, but understandable. It's unforgivable when the base cost is 70 USD, and another 40 for a ""character pass"" that includes 4 characters and nothing else. 

More concerning is the way Bandai Namco handled this. The Tekken Team has always said one thing and done another regarding these policies. Murray and Harada were on record saying there would be no in-game store, battle pass, or loot boxes. But without fail, all of these things have come to pass. The only caveat is potentially the loot boxes -- the asset is currently being used to advertise bundled costume packages -- but give it time. Recently, Heihachi's stage was sold separately from his DLC -- a departure from Tekken 7's season pass, and the community has been up-in-arms over this. But I feel the Heihachi stage drama is  just a figurehead for a larger discontent that the community feels over constantly being asked to pay more and more for things that used to be free. 

The game needs a change in direction ala No Man's Sky at this point to right the ship. There's too much negativity surrounding it, and Bandai Namco need to re-establish good will with their players.

Despite purchasing the Deluxe or Ultimate editions, players are still required to pay for additional content for the season which is evident with releases from the Tekken Shop, Battle Pass, and most recently paying for a stage (Heihachi) not included in the season pass. This paywall feels exploitative and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the game.
